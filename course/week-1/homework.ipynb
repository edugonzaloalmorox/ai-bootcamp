We\\'ll discuss going from\\n    bioinformatics to freelancing. We have a special guest today, Katya. As a freelancer\\n    Katya is helping companies bridge the gap between business and data by building\\n    actionable analytics and coaching the teams. She has a lot of broad experience\\n    in startups, entrepreneurship and scale-ups. Katya was head of analytics at Gitti,\\n    a beauty brand. She tried to start her own fintech business with Entrepreneur\\n    First and she worked as a data scientist at Zalando. Welcome to the show. It\\'s\\n    a pleasure to have you here.\\n  sec: 71\\n  time: \\'1:11\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, thank you so much for the invitation. It was really nice to catch up,\\n    actually. I think we\\'ve known each other for some time. I\\'m really happy to be\\n    here.\\n  sec: 112\\n  time: \\'1:52\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s background\\n- line: I tried to invite you multiple times. Finally, we managed to do this. [chuckles]\\n    Before we start with our main topic of being a data generalist, let\\'s start with\\n    your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?\\n  sec: 122\\n  time: \\'2:02\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. Let me start a bit from the very beginning and jump to what is happening\\n    right now. I started, as Alex mentioned, as a bioinformatician – a Bachelor’s\\n    and Master\\'s degrees in bioinformatics. I worked in different research institutes\\n    across Europe, Manchester University, Charité here in Berlin, and also at the\\n    Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona. After getting my Master\\'s degree,\\n    I realized that I was not motivated that much by research.\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: \\'2:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s where I switched directly to a startup and was a first data hire there.\\n    I was hired as a data analyst, and I ended up doing a lot of the data engineering\\n    part, which I loved, but I didn\\'t enjoy it  that much, maybe. Then I switched\\n    to Zalando. I also was there at Zalando Payments, where I was building real-time\\n    machine learning systems for fraud prediction and payment scoring. Basically,\\n    when you shop on Zalando and you get an invoice and the payment method, that\\'s\\n    exactly my team who built the algorithm behind that, to enable you to buy with\\n    this payment method. It was a super-heavy engineering team, lots of PhD people\\n    and lots of young people – so really ambitious, really nice. That\\'s where all\\n    my engineering background comes from.\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: \\'2:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then, after two years there, I was a bit stuck regarding learning. That\\'s\\n    when a very good friend of mine said, “Hey, why don\\'t you start something?” and\\n    that\\'s when I went to Entrepreneur First. You can imagine that there\\'s a startup\\n    accelerator, founded in London, they have programs across the globe. Basically,\\n    it\\'s pre-team, pre-idea. You go there as an individual, you need to identify yourself\\n    as a CEO or a CTO, and then it\\'s kind of like speed dating – speed co-founding.\\n    [chuckles] I\\'m more on the CTO side (a technical person) so I was trying to find\\n    a CEO match.\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: \\'2:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Basically, you work with one person, you match, and you work together for\\n    three days. Normally, after three days, you realize that either it’s going well\\n    or it’s not, because at the end of the day, startups fail because of the mismatch\\n    on founders. Within that program, I tried to found a fintech company, but I went\\n    really in a very different, weird segment – I went into compliance. It\\'s like\\n    the most unsexy and the most regulated thing ever. So I realized [cross-talk]\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: \\'2:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What is compliance?\\n  sec: 300\\n  time: \\'5:00\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Basically, it\\'s KYC – Know Your Customer – know your business. You need to\\n    do legal checks on the person –who you are as a person. Have you ever had bankruptcy?\\n    Are you associated with money laundering? Do you have a company that maybe was\\n    associated with money laundering? All those kinds of checks that, for instance,\\n    you also need to do when you open a bank account – then you do this postident\\n    thing. We went into the B2B “know your business” compliance part. After that,\\n    I realized that it was interesting, but… and we wanted to try to copycat an American\\n    startup, but it didn\\'t work here in Europe. Then Corona happened and I was really\\n    exhausted after almost six months of Entrepreneur First.\\n  sec: 302\\n  time: \\'5:02\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Really, seriously, I was not ready to found a company. It was like everybody\\n    around me were founding companies and I was like, “Okay, let me jump on that wave.”\\n    But internally and mentally and emotionally, I was not prepared. I would wake\\n    up two weeks in a row with that headache. That was already a sign that something\\n    was not going well. Then I joined Delivery Hero’s fintech department. And again,\\n    I was the first data scientist there. I also tried to build basically what we\\n    did at Zalando – the whole machine learning for fraud production. I love the people,\\n    but I didn\\'t feel that it was for me, so I left.\\n  sec: 302\\n  time: \\'5:02\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s when I joined Gitti, a direct-to-consumer brand, selling nail polishers.\\n    Within my junior period there, we went into the cosmetics segment. Also, they\\n    launched (I think several months ago) skincare. So it\\'s a beauty brand. There,\\n    I basically built the whole BI and team from scratch, and helped on the fundraising.\\n    Then on the first of September, I left Gitti to start freelancing.\\n  sec: 302\\n  time: \\'5:02\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: How Jekaterina started freelancing\\n- line: That\\'s quite a journey. What do you do as a freelancer? Maybe before you start\\n    telling us what you do now, it\\'s also interesting to know – how did you decide\\n    what you want to do as a freelancer?\\n  sec: 433\\n  time: \\'7:13\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Okay. I never tried to... I think I just asked myself the question, “What\\n    is the next step for me?” And then what happened? I had a Bumble date. I went\\n    on this Bumble date, and we didn’t match personally, but then the guy was like,\\n    “Hey, I will invite you to a founders dinner.” I went to the founders’ dinner.\\n    There were only founders there – I think 10 people. One guy arrived super late\\n    and we didn’t not chat with him. But what I did after was just add all the people\\n    who were there on LinkedIn. And this one guy that arrived super late wrote to\\n    me “Hey, Katya. We want to hire you.” And I\\'m like, “No, I don\\'t want to be hired.\\n    I want to do freelancing. What about it?”\\n  sec: 449\\n  time: \\'7:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then in three days, he sends me a freelancing contract, and I’m still at Gitti\\n    five days a week, and he sends me a freelance contract for one day a week. So\\n    I\\'m like, “What do I do now?” So I go to Gitti. I don\\'t know how, but I managed\\n    to convince them to give me a four days a week contract. I started freelancing\\n    for the company. Now, it\\'s also interesting because today, this company (Kittl)\\n    announced a Series A fundraiser of 11 million. That’s what I was hired for back\\n    then – to help them with the fundraising, building the data deck. So that\\'s how\\n    it started. They are a SaaS company. It\\'s a completely different business model\\n    than what I\\'m used to at Gitti, because Gitti is typical ecommerce.\\n  sec: 449\\n  time: \\'7:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: After a month of freelancing I was like, “That looks really good. I really\\n    enjoy that.” Then some friends reached out and I was like, “Okay, let me help\\n    you.” And then I decided just to leave Gitti and see what kind of clients I could\\n    attract. I didn\\'t even know what kind of clients I should attract. I was like,\\n    “Okay, let\\'s just leave and figure this out.”\\n  sec: 449\\n  time: \\'7:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s quite optimistic. So you left. How did you actually figure out what\\n    kind of services companies need? Was it just ad hoc meetings in Bumble? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 580\\n  time: \\'9:40\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'[laughs] No, then I switched to Tinder. [chuckles] I mean, it was still calculated\\n    risk because I had this one client at the end of the day – one long term client\\n    and one more kind of short-term client. So it was not like I decided, “Today I\\n    leave.” and then I left. No, it was more of a calculated risk in that I still\\n    have income (at least something) that would allow me to start.\\'\\n  sec: 593\\n  time: \\'9:53\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I left and then in September/October I was sitting on my couch. I was like,\\n    “I don\\'t have clients. I don\\'t have income.” I was tapping into my savings and\\n    I started panicking. Of course, I didn\\'t announce to anybody that I was freelancing.\\n    So how should anybody know about that?\\n  sec: 593\\n  time: \\'9:53\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s initial ways of getting freelancing clients\\n- line: So you quit but nobody knew that you were a freelancer?\\n  sec: 644\\n  time: \\'10:44\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly! I didn\\'t announce it on LinkedIn. I didn\\'t tell anybody. I mean,\\n    some people knew. I had connections. But it was not enough to pay the bills at\\n    the end of the day. That was a hard realization, because I was like, “Whoa, if\\n    I can\\'t make money, now I need to go back to work for someone.” That really hit\\n    me. So what I decided to do was announce that I\\'m freelancing right now, but not\\n    like, “Hey, I\\'m a data freelancer. I\\'m here. Pay me!” But rather to do a series\\n    of LinkedIn posts – I think there were eight LinkedIn posts directed at... [cross-talk]\\n  sec: 647\\n  time: \\'10:47\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I saw one of them and I thought, “Okay. Actually, I wanted to invite you for\\n    a long time. So let me do this.” [chuckles] Sorry for interrupting. That helps\\n    to get noticed, right?\\n  sec: 690\\n  time: \\'11:30\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly, especially with selfies. If you post a selfie, it\\'s crazy how many\\n    people immediately recognize you. If they associate your face with a topic, it\\'s\\n    even much easier at the end of the day. So I created those eight posts addressing\\n    direct-to-consumer brands on how to structure their KPIs, what to look at, when\\n    to look at this, how to come up with easy KPIs and not with super-complicated\\n    ones. And of course, with a selfie. [chuckles] I was posting for two weeks, I\\n    think, and I got two clients out of that.\\n  sec: 701\\n  time: \\'11:41\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: How did you feel about posting selfies?\\n  sec: 746\\n  time: \\'12:26\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: It was so hard. It was so weird. Also doing selfies… I mean, I do have Instagram,\\n    but I have a closed Instagram. It\\'s a different thing. But on LinkedIn it’s a\\n    professional thing. I was like, “It\\'s so uncomfortable.” But that\\'s the thing,\\n    you need to do what you need to do and then you just do it. The funny part is,\\n    the first and second post, I was like, “Oh my god, this is so awful.” But then\\n    I didn\\'t care anymore because I just got so many likes and so many shares as well.\\n    People were also writing to me, “Hey, you\\'re doing a great job.” I was like, “Pff.\\n    Okay, then let\\'s do more selfies.” [laughs]\\n  sec: 749\\n  time: \\'12:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I still don\\'t know if I\\'ll ever post a selfie on LinkedIn. [chuckles] Because\\n    it’s so awkward, at least to me.\\n  sec: 792\\n  time: \\'13:12\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I know, it’s really awkward. But I was like, “Eh, whatever. Let\\'s just see\\n    how it works out.” And then exactly – I got two clients there.\\n  sec: 800\\n  time: \\'13:20\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: And you got clients in the segment that you wanted, right? These are direct-to-consumer\\n    brands who need help structuring their KPIs?\\n  sec: 812\\n  time: \\'13:32\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: That\\'s funny enough. One is not. One is kind of a marketplace. It\\'s kind of\\n    similar to a direct-to-consumer brand, but a marketplace. And another one was\\n    a very German company Mittelstand somewhere not far from Munich. What they wanted\\n    – and that\\'s so crazy because my profile is so broad, I can do so much stuff that\\n    it\\'s also hard for me to understand what pain point I\\'m solving exactly. So that\\n    company wanted – they had lots of data, different kinds of data and they wanted\\n    to make a project with me on how to monetize this data. I would go and figure\\n    out if we can sell this data to the government or to the job centers or to whatever.\\n    So it\\'s not working with the data, but rather trying to find revenue streams for\\n    the data that they have.\\n  sec: 821\\n  time: \\'13:41\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: It\\'s completely different. It\\'s not direct-to-consumer. It\\'s completely different\\n    things. And that\\'s so funny. I have three kinds of different clients. One client\\n    wants to have this full experience of having a head of analytics, who would negotiate\\n    with the vendors, who will sign the contract… well, not sign the contracts, but\\n    make sure that the contracts are written properly and owning everything end to\\n    end. It\\'s like an internal data team basically.\\n  sec: 821\\n  time: \\'13:41\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Another client really wants help only with the fundraising. Third client wants\\n    me to coach their data team and the business team, because sometimes it happens\\n    that they don\\'t chat with each other. Another (fourth) type of client hired me\\n    to automate some stuff that is just hard for them to do in Google Sheets. I just\\n    have those small technical projects. It’s four different kinds of ways, or packages,\\n    that I can offer – and that\\'s why it\\'s hard to communicate what exactly I’m offering.\\n  sec: 821\\n  time: \\'13:41\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: But you still managed to get clients, then I guess it works.\\n  sec: 953\\n  time: \\'15:53\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah, exactly. It\\'s more for all those LinkedIn posts – when you do something\\n    like that, you really need to understand who you\\'re targeting and then adjust\\n    the messaging for them. Because if it\\'s too broad, people don\\'t feel that they\\n    are being addressed.\\n  sec: 957\\n  time: \\'15:57\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: You\\'re still targeting the same audience – the same people, right? Direct-to-consumer\\n    brands?\\n  sec: 975\\n  time: \\'16:15\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I try to, because that\\'s where most of my knowledge comes from, basically.\\n    Yeah.\\n  sec: 981\\n  time: \\'16:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: How being a generalist helped Jekaterina’s career\\n- line: But from what you said about your knowledge and your background, you did pretty\\n    much everything when it comes to data. Maybe you didn’t do MLOps, or at least\\n    you didn\\'t tell us about that, but every single data role that is out there, you\\n    did this. You did data analysis, and as a data analyst, you needed to do data\\n    engineering. Then you did data science at Zalando.\\n  sec: 990\\n  time: \\'16:30\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Then you worked at Gitti as a head of BI, or somebody that set up the BI team.\\n    I don’t know, you didn\\'t work maybe as an ML engineer, but apart from that… or\\n    maybe you actually did do some stuff there, too. So it\\'s like everything. Also,\\n    in addition to that, you tried a startup. That\\'s a lot. Maybe the question I have\\n    is – it seems like you enjoy doing different things.\\n  sec: 990\\n  time: \\'16:30\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: But does it help you in your career to know so many things and to be interested\\n    in so many areas?\\n  sec: 990\\n  time: \\'16:30\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. That\\'s this whole generalist part, right? I never wanted to be a specialist\\n    in anything. I never wanted to optimize, to figure out how many layers I want\\n    to have in my deep learning model. I\\'m not excited about that. You immediately\\n    see on my face, I\\'m like “Ugh”. But what I really get excited about is connecting\\n    the dots between all those specialized people in the business. Because I did data\\n    engineering, I did a bit of MLOps as well by the way, I did a bit of marketing\\n    analytics, I did BI, I did tracking (I hate tracking [chuckles]) – this whole\\n    Google Analytics thing, but I also did that. Then I can challenge all of those\\n    parts and know the best practices there. Can I do it myself? Some of the stuff,\\n    yes and some of the stuff, no.\\n  sec: 1055\\n  time: \\'17:35\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then it also starts to be – I\\'m not a profile for corporate companies, for\\n    instance. For Zalando right now, what I enjoy doing and what I collected over\\n    the time – I\\'m not the best fit. For Delivery Hero either, I\\'m not the best fit.\\n    Because they are searching for very specialized people and I don\\'t want to do\\n    that. My profile, this whole generalistic approach, works better for startups,\\n    where I can chat with the business, and I can easily explain the numbers to them\\n    and then they can go to the marketing team and figure out their marketing analytics\\n    or go to the tech team and speak their language.\\n  sec: 1055\\n  time: \\'17:35\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s so funny, because bioinformatics, it\\'s a bridge between informaticians\\n    and biologists because those two don\\'t know how to communicate with each other.\\n    Throughout my entire career, I was always just this person who links someone but\\n    doesn\\'t know anything in depth. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1055\\n  time: \\'17:35\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Do you think it somehow makes your chances of having a successful career smaller?\\n    Or do you think it\\'s fine?\\n  sec: 1176\\n  time: \\'19:36\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: If you\\'re a generalist sitting in Zalando, and you need to optimize for deep\\n    learning models, you will be internally unhappy by default. And if you\\'re internally\\n    unhappy in your job, you will not succeed in this job. In order to succeed, you\\n    need to be happy. [laughs] [Alexey agrees] I think it boils down to this – the\\n    more excited you are, the more you overdeliver. Maybe let me brag. It was so crazy\\n    right now.\\n  sec: 1189\\n  time: \\'19:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: For one of my clients, they were using Fivetran. Fivetran is a data extraction\\n    tool. Basically, it gets the data, let\\'s say, from Shopify and packs the raw data\\n    into the data warehouse. What I figured out is that they had a bug in their codebase\\n    for how they calculate spends on Google ads. What I did is just push the fix to\\n    their codebase and it got merged. This thing just made me so happy. The client\\n    was like, “What?! You just improved our vendor codebase!” I\\'m like, “Yes.” I\\'m\\n    just super happy about this. Once you\\'re happy, you\\'re going this extra mile,\\n    and you\\'re enjoying it. You are enjoying working until super late.\\n  sec: 1189\\n  time: \\'19:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Connecting business and data\\n- line: But it still looks like you somewhat have focus right now. Right now, at least\\n    your posts focus on KPIs. I guess, this is related to what you said you enjoyed\\n    doing most, which is connecting the dots between different people and engineers.\\n    That\\'s correct, right? Right now, this is your focus?\\n  sec: 1282\\n  time: \\'21:22\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, right now I\\'m focusing on connecting the dots between business and data.\\n    Basically, helping business people understand how to steer their business and\\n    according to what numbers – easy numbers or even more complicated numbers, and\\n    how to transfer those KPIs or this logic for KPIs into the infrastructure. What\\n    do I need there? Do I need help from the tech team? I cannot do it myself. How\\n    can I do it? And do I do this whole implementation or outsource this implementation?\\n    But I know exactly what the steps there are.\\n  sec: 1309\\n  time: \\'21:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: So the focus right now is on working together with the founders or business\\n    people and to translate this everything into the data parts. Again, for instance,\\n    data science, for me, is out of the question right now, because I\\'m working with\\n    the founders, who just really need to know, “What was our revenue yesterday? What\\n    did we pay for the customers yesterday? What was the percentage of returning customers?”\\n    That’s easier stuff, but that\\'s what they need to know in order to understand\\n    how to steer the business and how the business is going. Even at Gitti, we never\\n    started with data science, although I wanted to, but just the business was not\\n    there.\\n  sec: 1309\\n  time: \\'21:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: How Jekaterina’s LinkedIn posts helped her get clients\\n- line: I see that we have a few questions and some of them are related to the discussion.\\n    A question from Adonis is related to your posts. The question is, “Looking back,\\n    what was the most important thing about the posts that helped you get the clients?”\\n  sec: 1389\\n  time: \\'23:09\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'What was the most important thing in the LinkedIn posts? Really, it was three\\n    things: figuring out who I am addressing so that I would structure the posts in\\n    a way that the people who read it will understand immediately that I\\'\\'m addressing\\n    them. You don\\'\\'t start with “What will my post be?” You start with “What is my\\n    audience? What\\'\\'s the type of voice I\\'\\'m using?” Am I professional, flirty, and\\n    humorous or am I super professional? What is the style? This is one thing.\\'\\n  sec: 1406\\n  time: \\'23:26\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then the second thing is, I shared those posts with two of my friends, and\\n    they had brutal feedback on that. I took it, I improved it – done. So getting\\n    feedback was the second thing. And the third one, I think it was one of the hardest\\n    – to put myself out there with those selfies. That\\'s where internally I had to\\n    struggle with myself. That\\'s where you also realize that might be the point when\\n    you\\'re getting out of your comfort zone, which also might be good. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1406\\n  time: \\'23:26\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: We already discussed who you are addressing – direct-to-consumer brands who\\n    are interested in improving or defining their KPIs. What about the type of voice\\n    and style? Is it flirty, as you said, or is it professional? How do you decide?\\n    Do you test this? Or do you just assume that this one will work better? Maybe\\n    walk us through one of the posts and how you did it.\\n  sec: 1488\\n  time: \\'24:48\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: What I realized is that I love chatting with people. I\\'m loud. I love laughing.\\n    I love stupid jokes. I love clever jokes. But I can also be serious, professional\\n    and clever and figure out stuff and help people. That\\'s what I thought – I wanted\\n    to bring my personality over through those posts. Basically, professional, clever,\\n    but filled with a bit of my weird humor. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1515\\n  time: \\'25:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I also wanted to kind of reflect this whole journey a bit. I realized that\\n    I don\\'t want to fake anything. At the end of the day, clients are not only paying\\n    for the infrastructure, they are paying for the whole package. The whole package\\n    is this energetic person who comes into the room and is always saying hi to everyone\\n    and even entertains the team sometimes. This energy is what people pay for as\\n    well, at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 1515\\n  time: \\'25:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Do you have any go-to stupid jokes that you use to energize the team? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1584\\n  time: \\'26:24\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Oh, no. It\\'s super ad hoc-ey, right? It\\'s not even stupid joking. It\\'s rather\\n    those internal jokes that you get with the teams, while you sit with them. You\\n    just start to be friends with those people, right? It\\'s so funny, with all my\\n    clients, with the older teams, I\\'m in a really good relationship, and they are\\n    super happy to see me and I\\'m also super happy to see them. So you start to have\\n    those internal jokes at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 1589\\n  time: \\'26:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I\\'m trying to make a connection between the posts that target a specific audience\\n    and the four different types of work that you do. To me, they don\\'t seem super\\n    related. The posts are KPI-related but, as you said, your work falls into four\\n    different buckets – full experience as a head of analytics, fundraising, coaching\\n    data and business teams, and then automating stuff. These are the kinds of different\\n    packages. So how did the posts help you get things that don\\'t seem very related?\\n  sec: 1623\\n  time: \\'27:03\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah, it’s because of the reach. They figured out, “Hey, this person knows\\n    something. What she writes makes sense. Let’s just chat with her.” People kind\\n    of relate it. Of course, fundraising is another thing. But people relate that,\\n    “Okay, she\\'s technical enough that she can automate some stuff and she understands\\n    me immediately.” That\\'s what I meant. It\\'s hard for me and that\\'s what I need\\n    to figure out – how to transmit the message of what I really do.\\n  sec: 1665\\n  time: \\'27:45\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: At the end of the day, what do I really want to do? Fundraising is super tiresome.\\n    I had calls at 11 PM and had to work till 3 AM because in the morning we had to\\n    submit everything to the investor. It\\'s not this dream job. It\\'s super intense.\\n    The day after, I was just lying in my bed sleeping. So do I want to do this job\\n    for the next three years? Or what is it exactly that I\\'m enjoying the most where\\n    I don\\'t burn myself out either? First, I need to actually figure out this part\\n    and then I need to figure out how to transmit it through a LinkedIn post so that\\n    I attract the right audience as well.\\n  sec: 1665\\n  time: \\'27:45\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s work in fundraising\\n- line: But for you as a generalist, what you enjoy now might not be the same as what\\n    you enjoy tomorrow, right? How do you live with this? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1750\\n  time: \\'29:10\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah. Yes, exactly. That\\'s a good question. Right now, I know that fundraising\\n    is fun and that\\'s where you get lots of understanding about things like what investors\\n    want, how they steer the business, or want to steer the business, but it\\'s super\\n    intense. Let\\'s put it differently. At the end of the day, what matters are also\\n    people – who you work with.\\n  sec: 1761\\n  time: \\'29:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: All my clients are super fun, nice people. Sometimes, of course, there are\\n    some parts that I don\\'t enjoy doing like data warehouse optimization. I\\'m like,\\n    “Whaaaat?” But that still helps – the people help, this whole atmosphere helps.\\n    That\\'s where I’m still not sure which direction to go in, regarding what I love.\\n    Plus, is there a market for that as well? Fundraising doesn\\'t happen every day.\\n  sec: 1761\\n  time: \\'29:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What kind of work exactly do you do for fundraising? I guess it\\'s somehow\\n    still related to KPIs? You need to show the company in a good light, “Okay, these\\n    are the KPIs and this is how the KPIs look so far and this is how they will look\\n    in the future.” So you\\'re still kind of connecting business and data for fundraising.\\n    Right?\\n  sec: 1826\\n  time: \\'30:26\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly, exactly. Basically, there are just questions of cohorts, “How active\\n    are our cohorts?” And I sit together with the founder and we define what a cohort\\n    actually is, what retention actually is, and how we calculate this. Then, there\\n    are 10 different ways of how we can calculate it and you decide, “Okay, which\\n    one so I submit and how do I visualize it?” And if there is some kind of weird\\n    stuff happening, “How do I explain this so that investors don\\'t find it weird.”\\n    Basically, we sit together with the business and try to figure out how to show,\\n    what to show, and then I just go collect the data through different databases,\\n    different systems, wrangle something in Python, create the charts in Google Sheets.\\n    I started loving Google Sheets. [chuckles] And then it’s iterate, iterate, iterate.\\n    And then maybe investors sometimes have other questions.\\n  sec: 1845\\n  time: \\'30:45\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Cohorts and KPIs\\n- line: Do you have any examples of these cohorts and KPIs? Maybe it doesn\\'t have\\n    to come from a specific client, but just to understand what exactly you do.\\n  sec: 1906\\n  time: \\'31:46\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. For instance, for SaaS, the business to consumer segment (not B2B, but\\n    B2C). There, you sign up. Let’s take Facebook for example – you sign up and then\\n    you can post, you can like, you can just be active on the platform. Now the question\\n    is – those who signed up in April, how active are they? That\\'s where you define\\n    activity. What is activity? Is it liking? Is it scrolling? Is it whatever? Those\\n    who signed up in April, how active are they compared to those who signed up in\\n    September, for instance? And if you see that September cohort is really bad, you\\'re\\n    like, “Okay, what happened? Did our product start to be really bad? Yes, no? Is\\n    it the traffic that marketing\\'s attracting? Is it bad or good? Yes, no?” Then\\n    you start to dig deeper like, “What is it about those people that they are just\\n    not active on the platform from specific cohorts?”\\n  sec: 1915\\n  time: \\'31:55\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Okay, first it\\'s about defining KPIs, then defining cohorts, doing some analysis,\\n    showing charts, and then if something is off, going there and understanding what\\'s\\n    happening. You do this for fundraising, too? Does it help to attract more money?\\n  sec: 1991\\n  time: \\'33:11\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. That\\'s so funny, half of the stuff that is normally done for fundraising\\n    can also be reused in the business – to look at this on a monthly level. Some\\n    of the stuff we never implemented – it\\'s only for fundraising. But yeah, it\\'s\\n    kind of how business wants to steer and then we just figure out how to see how\\n    the business performs. What are the users doing? Why are they doing it?\\n  sec: 2012\\n  time: \\'33:32\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Improving communication between the data and business teams\\n- line: We spoke about fundraising to some extent, but I\\'m also curious about the\\n    other three parts, especially this coaching data and the business team aspect.\\n    How is it similar? How is it related? What do you do there?\\n  sec: 2043\\n  time: \\'34:03\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: This project will be… I\\'m not doing it right now, it\\'s one of the future projects.\\n    The problem there is that the company is pretty... It\\'s like six, seven years\\n    old. They do have the data team, they do have the business team. However, it\\'s\\n    hard for businesses to be data-driven because nobody coached them to be data-driven.\\n    What is data driven nowadays? Everybody uses this word, but nobody can explain\\n    what it actually means at the end of the day or how to actually start being this.\\n    So the business team is super frustrated. They need to be data-driven, but they\\n    have no clue how and what this means. Then the data team is there, and they need\\n    to manage all these ad hoc requests. The infrastructure might already be outdated.\\n    And then they don\\'t understand just what the business team needs because they\\n    don\\'t have time to understand the business.\\n  sec: 2056\\n  time: \\'34:16\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Those people are not business savvy. That\\'s the thing, you have engineers\\n    or data people who are not business savvy and you have business people who are\\n    not data savvy, so it will not work by default. And that\\'s where I try to help.\\n    Well, I try to help the business people to be more data-driven, or data savvy,\\n    and the data people to be more business savvy. Then once all those two parties\\n    go towards each other a bit, like one step, then it\\'s already a success at the\\n    end of the day. It\\'s also hard for me to measure the success because what I do\\n    is just coach them on how to communicate with each other. [chuckles] How do you\\n    measure communication – the success of my work? It takes time, right? It takes\\n    even several months, actually, when business will know the impact of this coaching.\\n  sec: 2056\\n  time: \\'34:16\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: So you kind of act as a translator – you translate from one language to another.\\n    But then, I guess, the ultimate goal is to let people be able to talk between\\n    each other without you, right? [Jekaterina agrees] You do this, then you leave,\\n    and you help somebody else achieve the same.\\n  sec: 2170\\n  time: \\'36:10\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly. That\\'s exactly what I was doing with bioinformatics as well – helping\\n    those informaticians and  biologists actually to make sure that this whole thing\\n    works together.\\n  sec: 2189\\n  time: \\'36:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Motivating every link in the company’s chain\\n- line: I think you mentioned that. The question I have right now is “How does being\\n    a generalist help you now?” And I think one thing you mentioned is – you\\'ve done\\n    a lot of stuff already, so sometimes you can just go ahead and do this. Even if\\n    you don\\'t do this yourself, you kind of have an idea in your mind of how you would\\n    approach this. So that\\'s one thing, I think, that can help you in your current\\n    role. Are there other things that you think are also helpful for you right now?\\n  sec: 2203\\n  time: \\'36:43\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. I also mentioned that I know best practices. That\\'s so funny, people\\n    know that I know best practices. but I don\\'t know… I know what doesn\\'t work for\\n    sure. Those mistakes are normally done by young teams over and over. You see the\\n    patterns, and you\\'re like, “Hey, I already know now that in three months we\\'ll\\n    struggle with that. So let\\'s not do that.” So that’s knowing what doesn\\'t work\\n    because I was in those different roles, it helps me now to prevent, let\\'s call\\n    them “disasters,” in the future.\\n  sec: 2234\\n  time: \\'37:14\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Also, it\\'s all about the people\\'s communication. You just adjust to how people\\n    communicate, and then you try to communicate in their language. That\\'s why, with\\n    the generalist part – I chatted with so many different people. I had to chat with\\n    the data engineers, PMS, CEOs, CTOs, CPOs. And you need to find a way of how to\\n    make them what you want them to make. [chuckles] That entails different approaches\\n    to different people. You need to know how to motivate every segment of it – every\\n    person, basically.\\n  sec: 2234\\n  time: \\'37:14\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: The cons of freelancing\\n- line: Are there any cons of freelancing? Are there any cons of being a generalist\\n    when freelancing right now?\\n  sec: 2325\\n  time: \\'38:45\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, it’s hard to sell myself, because people just ask, “Hey, Katya – what\\n    is the difference between you and a data agency?” This is also a hard explanation\\n    for me to actually define the real difference there, because again, people also\\n    pay for this energy. How do I tell them, “Hey, you will pay for the nice mood\\n    that you will have in the office?” [chuckles] It doesn\\'t work that way.\\n  sec: 2336\\n  time: \\'38:56\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That’s too bad. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2366\\n  time: \\'39:26\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. [chuckle] So I think it\\'s hard for me to sell this generalistic thing\\n    because there are lots of other agencies or freelancers who have a very specialized\\n    focus and then people ask me, “What is the difference between you and them?\\n  sec: 2367\\n  time: \\'39:27\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What is a data agency?\\n  sec: 2390\\n  time: \\'39:50\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: There are several data agencies in Berlin that help direct-to-consumer brands\\n    build data warehouses, reporting tools on top of it, and dashboards. They may\\n    also might help a bit with the tracking. I\\'m kind of competing with them, but\\n    on the other hand, I\\'m not. Because I\\'m not going against the typical data engineer\\n    – I\\'m more this holistic who will really fit with the business-first, figure things\\n    out and then implement.\\n  sec: 2393\\n  time: \\'39:53\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: From what you described in terms of what data agencies do, it looks like they\\n    already have some packages. If I know that I need a data warehouse, I go to them,\\n    and I tell them, “Hey, come over and build me a data warehouse.” But what if I\\n    don\\'t know that I need a data warehouse? Who do I go to?\\n  sec: 2429\\n  time: \\'40:29\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, that\\'s the thing. Everything is about how you sell yourself. Data agencies\\n    don\\'t sell themselves by saying, “We’ll build your data warehouse.” They sell\\n    dashboards. And that\\'s what the CEO and CPO and the business founders need, right?\\n    What is in the back? They\\'re like, “I don\\'t care. I just want this fancy dashboard\\n    that shows me my sales for the last several days.” Of course, the agencies figured\\n    out that this is a selling point – their selling audience is actually C-level\\n    (CMO, CEO, CPOs). If there’s a CTO, that already means that they might be a tech\\n    team who can kind of handle that. Those people are the selling points. So how\\n    do I adjust my messaging to those people? That\\'s the thing, again, adjusting the\\n    messaging so that the customers feel addressed at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 2447\\n  time: \\'40:47\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: So how do you compete with them? By making selfies? [Jekaterina laughs] Posting\\n    selfies on LinkedIn? Because I don\\'t think they do this, right? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2504\\n  time: \\'41:44\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: No. [laughs] Exactly. What I feel is that I\\'m more on the business side. I\\n    try to be more on the business side and because I was operationally involved at\\n    Gitti at steering business with data, and also in the fundraising events, which\\n    is experience that those agencies don\\'t have – operationally being involved in\\n    businesses, helping the marketing team. They just come, build, they leave (normally).\\n    Of course, sometimes they maintain the infrastructure and maintain the dashboards,\\n    but they are not actively involved in the business team. And that\\'s where I get\\n    involved immediately.\\n  sec: 2512\\n  time: \\'41:52\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Balancing projects and networking\\n- line: Okay. We have a few more questions. A question from Claire, “What are the\\n    pros and cons of freelancing, according to your experience?”\\n  sec: 2560\\n  time: \\'42:40\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah, we discussed this with Alex before – don\\'t be confused by this “free”\\n    prefix in “freelancing”. You\\'re free in terms of choosing who you work with and\\n    when you work, but that doesn\\'t mean that you will now surf for a week and then\\n    can maybe do three hours of work. This doesn\\'t work, because you need to work\\n    on the project that you have right now, but you also need to grow your own freelancing\\n    business. This basically entails reaching out to new customers, or helping them\\n    somehow, so that you get the audience of people who know you. You need to make\\n    this audience bigger. Those are two things that you need to do in parallel.\\n  sec: 2571\\n  time: \\'42:51\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s why there\\'s not so much “free” time in freelancing at the end of the\\n    day. The process that I use, for instance, I like to work with ambitious people\\n    – startups. Those are very motivated people, fast people, fast thinkers – they\\n    want to solve the problem. I\\'m really intrigued by those kinds of people. The\\n    disadvantage of freelancing is that sometimes – one month you will be without\\n    money. How do you deal with this? That means that if I earn like 10K today, that\\n    doesn\\'t mean that I need to spend those 10K today. That means that I need to distribute\\n    those 10K and do this whole financial planning of my life, so that I can buy food.\\n    This is exactly what hit me in September/October. I was just without clients,\\n    so without the proper income. And this is a bit scary.\\n  sec: 2571\\n  time: \\'42:51\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: How do you deal with this stress? By planning things?\\n  sec: 2685\\n  time: \\'44:45\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I mean, yes, planning. Also, knowing exactly how much you spend and not overspend.\\n    You must see that you’re not only working on your project, but you’re also growing\\n    this audience that will become the leads afterward. Basically, projects are short-term\\n    optimization, but this growth of the audience is long-term optimization, where\\n    you don\\'t know what will come out of this at the end. That’s the instability or\\n    the risk that you just take. Of course, you should not go freelancing if you don\\'t\\n    have any savings. That\\'s hard. Mentally, this will be very hard.\\n  sec: 2689\\n  time: \\'44:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Or at least if you have a client lined up for the next half a year. Right?\\n  sec: 2738\\n  time: \\'45:38\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. Exactly. Then it\\'s fine. The hardest part… if you don\\'t have clients,\\n    you will figure it out. Maybe you can go to the coffee shop and work there. You\\n    will figure it out. But mental health and this mental instability – that hits\\n    hard.\\n  sec: 2743\\n  time: \\'45:43\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What do you do for that? How do you deal with this?\\n  sec: 2765\\n  time: \\'46:05\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: In September/October, when I was sitting without clients, I was like, “Whoa.”\\n    I was immediately thinking, “Okay, can I sell something on those platforms where\\n    freelancers do some kind of small stuff for you? Do I need to sign up for the\\n    freelancers networks? What should I do?”\\n  sec: 2769\\n  time: \\'46:09\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Like Fiverr, right? These kinds of places?\\n  sec: 2787\\n  time: \\'46:27\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, exactly. Then I was like “This is not what I want to do at the end of\\n    the day.” And then I came up with those posts. So you need to be creative, and\\n    you will be creative once you realize… [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2788\\n  time: \\'46:28\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That if you don\\'t, then you won’t have anything to eat, right?\\n  sec: 2805\\n  time: \\'46:45\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly. But that\\'s the funny part. There should be calculated risks. I didn\\'t\\n    go freelancing all of a sudden. I had a customer already, where I was like, “Okay,\\n    we discussed things. It’s been going well for several months. I feel good. They\\n    feel good about me.” So that\\'s when I felt like, “Okay, I can leave my stable\\n    job.” And then, I learned about this myself, that I can stretch myself – I started\\n    to learn about my boundaries, about my limitations, and also about myself more,\\n    once I got out of my comfort zone. That\\'s the thing. Oh! One more thing that\\'s\\n    crazy with freelancing – every new client will challenge you. I feel like I’m\\n    constantly in the job application process and in a constant salary negotiation\\n    process. You come in and what I\\'m used to at Gitti, but had been working there\\n    for two years – I had lots of freedom, but only because I earned this freedom.\\n    With every new client, I don\\'t have this freedom. I don\\'t have this trust. So\\n    I need to build this trust, and building this trust with every client is hard.\\n    It takes time. That\\'s where I was like “Woah, constant salary negotiations, constant\\n    job application, constant building trust… this is hard.”\\n  sec: 2808\\n  time: \\'46:48\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Yeah, it does sound very hard. Do you work more now than compared to previously?\\n  sec: 2895\\n  time: \\'48:15\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. Yes, I do work more. That\\'s the thing, chatting with people – do you\\n    consider that work or not work? Growing this audience.\\n  sec: 2903\\n  time: \\'48:23\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Networking. Yeah. Okay.\\n  sec: 2915\\n  time: \\'48:35\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- header: The importance of enjoying what you do\\n- line: That\\'s the question – you, as a person, are you happy doing that? If you\\'re\\n    happy doing that, if you enjoy having three coffee meetings during the day in\\n    different parts of the city and you\\'re running around like crazy – and you need\\n    to come to those meetings as if you\\'re fresh, energized. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2916\\n  time: \\'48:36\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: And you still need to do work for other clients. Right?\\n  sec: 2938\\n  time: \\'48:58\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly. Again, if it makes you happy, if you have the energy for that – and\\n    you need to create this energy, energy doesn\\'t come from out of the blue – then\\n    yes, you will enjoy that. And it doesn\\'t matter how long you will work at the\\n    end of the day. But it\\'s also the question of “Is it working hours or not?” That\\'s\\n    the thing, chatting with people – I don\\'t see that as working hours. But for those\\n    hours, currently, I\\'m not paid either.\\n  sec: 2941\\n  time: \\'49:01\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: How do you create this energy? Where do you get it from?\\n  sec: 2971\\n  time: \\'49:31\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I don\\'t know. [laughs]\\n  sec: 2974\\n  time: \\'49:34\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Do you just naturally come refreshed to every meeting?\\n  sec: 2981\\n  time: \\'49:41\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: No, the thing is that I think before joining Gitti, I was calmer and maybe\\n    scattered and maybe also more irritated by some stuff. That\\'s what I love about\\n    Gitti, as I also said to the founder – I was able to see within Gitti, that I\\n    managed to do lots of things and that I was able to get out of my comfort zone\\n    and achieve lots of stuff. I always felt like, “There is a problem. Yes, it\\'s\\n    a problem but I will figure out how to do this.” This belief that you will figure\\n    it out somehow turned back to me as, “I don\\'t need to be sad. I don\\'t need to\\n    be depressed about this. I will figure this out.” This was a mind change for me.\\n    That\\'s where I am now. I\\'m super happy with what I\\'m doing again. This happiness\\n    creates the energy at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 2984\\n  time: \\'49:44\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: In some ways, the secret is positive self-talk. Right?\\n  sec: 3057\\n  time: \\'50:57\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'[chuckles] Exactly. But that\\'\\'s the thing, if you start doubting yourself,\\n    that\\'\\'s the most negative energy that you can have. It will not help further.\\'\\n  sec: 3062\\n  time: \\'51:02\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Growing the client base\\n- line: Sarah wrote a comment “Passion and desire to help and the impact in many trials\\n    is so fulfilling.” [Jekaterina agrees] This is a good summary. So you said that\\n    in addition to “work,” meaning helping clients, you also need to grow your client\\n    base, you need to grow your network, you need to have leads for the next gigs.\\n    After you finish the current job, you need to have another one. The question from\\n    Wilhelm is, “How do you reach out for new clients? How do you grow your client\\n    base?”\\n  sec: 3076\\n  time: \\'51:16\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I don\\'t do cold outreach. This is hard. This is annoying. This makes me sad\\n    – when somebody doesn\\'t answer my message. [chuckles] So I decided not to go with\\n    that. Before I started posting on LinkedIn, what I did – I was invited to a Slack\\n    channel of direct-to-consumer brands, where founders and operators talk about\\n    where to get the best price for packaging, for instance. There were like 200 people,\\n    and I stalked all of them on LinkedIn. I was blocked by LinkedIn twice for several\\n    days because of this. Because I was just doing it really quickly. What I needed\\n    was for them to see that I checked them out. I didn\\'t care about their profiles.\\n    Then two people reached out to me as well from there. Basically, this stalking\\n    helped a bit. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 3113\\n  time: \\'51:53\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: It\\'s like cold outreach, but a little bit different, right? You stalk them,\\n    you make sure that they have this view – in LinkedIn, there is a setting that\\n    lets people see that you visited their profile. This is enabled for you, so you\\n    visit their profile, they see it, and then they check your profile, right? And\\n    then they decide to talk to you themselves?\\n  sec: 3177\\n  time: \\'52:57\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. I mean, the conversion rate from 250 people to 2 people is super small,\\n    I agree. But it\\'s fine. It worked out. And it took me maybe one hour for two possible\\n    leads. Fine. So there’s that. Also, if somebody posts on LinkedIn, “Hey, I have\\n    this reporting. What is the best reporting tool?” Then I jump immediately on that\\n    question. I\\'m also in several private Slack channels where people ask questions\\n    and I also jumped on that. I\\'m like, “Okay, let me help you.”\\n  sec: 3201\\n  time: \\'53:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: There’s one potential client – well, not even potential, but we just chatted\\n    with her – her freelancer for Google Analytics is not answering her and she has\\n    a project where she wants to move from GA3 to GA4 and adjust some stuff. So I\\n    was like, “Hey, let\\'s have a chat. I want to understand your problem. I might\\n    not be able to do that, but I know people who might be able to do that.” We just\\n    chatted for 20 minutes and she was super thankful that I just reached out and\\n    helped her. It might not be that she converts to a customer, but she has seen\\n    my face, she has seen what I can do, so she can also maybe suggest me to someone.\\n  sec: 3201\\n  time: \\'53:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Okay, so networking – helping and stalking people on LinkedIn. [chuckles]\\n    That\\'s your secret?\\n  sec: 3289\\n  time: \\'54:49\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'[laughs] And selfies. Don’t forget selfies.\\'\\n  sec: 3295\\n  time: \\'54:55\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: In the office work vs working remotely\\n- line: Selfies, yeah. That\\'s the most important thing. Do you work remotely or is\\n    it always within Berlin in an office?\\n  sec: 3299\\n  time: \\'54:59\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I love being in the office. That\\'s where this whole energy is great – this\\n    whole communication with the team. I am not the typical digital nomad who will\\n    go to Bali, surf, and then work. I\\'m trying to always do 100%. So either 100%\\n    work or 100% vacation. I don’t do this whole workcation thing. No. I am still\\n    considering if I should stay in Germany and Berlin or if I should move somewhere\\n    else. I still don\\'t know.\\n  sec: 3308\\n  time: \\'55:08\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: But I feel now that there is a freedom for me. That\\'s where the “free” comes\\n    in. If I\\'m able to structure my clients in a way that I can work remotely for\\n    them, and I don\\'t need to be in the office, then I can move to wherever I want.\\n    This is also amazing. That\\'s where, all sudden, the advantage of this “free” in\\n    “freelance” comes in.\\n  sec: 3308\\n  time: \\'55:08\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s advice who people who feel stuck\\n- line: Interesting. I noticed that there is one question in the list of questions\\n    that we prepared. I don\\'t know if we have enough time – we only have three minutes\\n    – but maybe we can try to cover it quickly. What would be your advice for people\\n    who feel stuck at what they\\'re doing?\\n  sec: 3371\\n  time: \\'56:11\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Don\\'t sit, act. Act immediately. Again, don\\'t quit today. [chuckles] Don\\'t\\n    do that. Let\\'s say you\\'re a machine learning engineer, and you\\'re like, “I\\'m a\\n    bit stuck at work. What should I do?” Reach out to consultancies and talk to them.\\n    Maybe you could join them as a freelancer one day a week. Just start chatting\\n    with people and try to figure out what others can offer. Or do what I did as well.\\n    I reached out to data consultants – people who have a similar background to me,\\n    but much more experienced. He is targeting other customer groups. I just told\\n    him “Hey, I want to do this. What would be your advice?” Just start chatting with\\n    people and try to figure things out. Take calculated risks, but don\\'t sit on the\\n    call on the couch. Really just start doing something. Even small things are also\\n    fine.\\n  sec: 3390\\n  time: \\'56:30\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: If you feel stuck and you want to be a freelancer, this is what you should\\n    do? In general – talk to people, right?\\n  sec: 3454\\n  time: \\'57:34\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: But that\\'s the thing, even if you don\\'t want to do freelancing. Just start\\n    chatting with people who you think are exciting, who you think can help you with\\n    advice or something else. People love to help. People will write back.\\n  sec: 3462\\n  time: \\'57:42\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s resource recommendations\\n- line: Is there any book or other resource that you can recommend to the listeners?\\n  sec: 3483\\n  time: \\'58:03\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'Yes. I think there are two. One is more general, as in “generalist”. It’s\\n    called The Power of Moments: Why Certain Experiences Have Extraordinary Impact.\\n    Basically, they talk a lot about lots of things, like how to do storytelling with\\n    very nice examples from all over the world. They explain how to create moments\\n    for other people that they will remember and how to create this energy, and what\\n    it actually means to create this energy. I love this book.

       "  'content': \"This week, we'll talk about volunteering and open source work. We have a special guest today, Sara. Sara is a Google Developer expert in machine learning, a Google PhD fellow, and also a co-founder of AI Wonder Girls. She likes to demystify AI to empower individuals with tools and mindsets that require building solutions that matter to the community and humanity. We met with Sara in October, I think, at a conference in Porto. It was an amazing conference. We had a very nice chat. Sara was talking about what she does and I thought “She would be an amazing guest.” And here we are 3, 4, 5 months after that, finally. [chuckles] So, welcome to the interview. Thank you. The questions for today's interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer. As always, thanks, Johanna, for your help. Before we start – before we go into our main topic of open source work and volunteering – let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far? Yeah, sure. I got interested in AI in my first engineering year, back in 2016. We were part of an interesting journey called “Beyond Engineering” (educational engineering) where we had to contribute our engineering skills to help the locals. And that's actually what pushed me to start going this volunteering road, because I enjoyed it so much – giving back to the community and my skills that I wanted to do it as well. But from there, I started learning about what AI is. And obviously, like everyone, I started with Andrew Ng’s course, Machine Learning from Stanford. That's how, after that, I got into [inaudible] deep learning [inaudible], so on and so forth. On the side, I was volunteering my skills with Omdena AI, and then got an interesting internship from STEM-Away. That's how I actually got to where I am now [chuckles] doing my PhD in AI applied to help. One of the reasons why I actually wanted to do a PhD was to get deep learning research –applied research in industry. Obviously, if you're going to be doing research, you do need some kind of research intensive – that's a PhD for you. [chuckles] And what is your background? What were your studies about? Yeah. Actually, in our engineering, we were doing computer science. Our major was called Computer Science and Emerging Technologies Engineering. In our last year, I did a Big Data Engineering specialization. And then you liked it and you wanted to do more AI [Sara agrees] and this was a way… Yeah, in that same year (in 2017) I was interested… I was actually part of a Big Data Challenge for EEE. When we did that internship, I was like, “I really want to do this.” I was enamored by computer vision because I'm a vision person, most of the time. That's how I got interested in computer vision, and then from computer vision, I was really interested in the medical field. I watch a lot of medical dramas. That's how I wanted to do AI Applied to help in mind. Grey's Anatomy? Oh, I kind of watched that, but that wasn't my first choice. I usually prefer [inaudible] when it comes to doctor dramas because they're more thorough. Yeah, I also know Scrubs, but I guess it's also not really a very medical show, right? [Sara agrees] [chuckles] Okay, so your focus is on AI and healthcare, right? [Sara agrees] So what is your PhD about? It's about deep multi-modality learning for COVID-19 and IDT diagnosis. Practically, I am trying a bunch of CNM models and vision transformers. I mix and match, depending on the disease, different modalities. For example, for COVID, chest X-ray with CT – I feed them to the CNMs or the models I'm comparing to do a benchmark and see which models outperforms and which models for example… Which modality is actually much more efficient to our searching model than another? Why? And is it normal? For example, is it what doctors usually rely upon more than the other modality available on the modalities? That's practically, in simple words, what I'm doing. [chuckles] How long have you been doing this? Oh, this is like my fourth year. This is my final year. I'm just wrapping up the writing part. Final year, okay. So now you're almost finished? Right? Yes. No, no, I'm finished. I haven't done any experimentation for almost a year. Yeah. So you've been writing papers for a year? No, it’s more like I have been writing papers from the start of my PhD. My first paper was ready by… I believe it was November or something. It was ready, as it was circulating around journals. Because, by the way, the paper that was published just recently, just last year and this was the first paper that was written, all the other papers that have already been published, but it was still roaming around. Ah, so it took a bit of time. [Sara agrees] You're also a Google PhD fellow. [Sara agrees] What does that mean and how did you get it? Yeah. Actually, one of the things we don't have in Morocco, sadly, for now – we don't have funding for research. One of the things I had to do was find a funding source – a scholarship or something to help me support my studies. Way before that, I was involved in a lot of Google stuff, like with the GDG (Google Developers Groups). I knew they had a program called Google PhD Fellowship. I applied to it. I… What can I tell you? The thing is, if you want to apply for aid and you want to have a chance to be selected, please make sure that you focus on something they care about. For example, try to figure out what they're researching, especially, for example, a searching field – if you're doing it for healthcare. Figure out what they're interested in. Then the second thing is, it has to touch upon a SDG goal, like helping you or your community. And it has to help your community. That means if you're in Morocco, or if you're in a certain region, it has to help your region do something – it's going to be useful if people leverage that research or something. I think that's why I got it, but I believe strongly that most of the reasons why I really got it was not just around the proposal, but also, obviously, my supervisor. And the second thing is all of the works I have already done way before applying to it. I have done a lot of volunteer work; I have touched a lot – I've been [involved with] all kinds of different AI and applied it to different domains. So I think that's one of the reasons why I got it. So what is it all about? Usually, in the fellowship – you can think of it like a scholarship because it kind of is like a scholarship. They give you money, right? For example $10,000 per year. By the way, they increased that – now it's $12,000. But usually it’s $10,000 a year for three years, depending on the region. For example, Africa, this is what we have. I believe in the US, they only give them for one year, because usually they do have funding. What do they give you on top of the money, is they also give you a Google mentor and it's up to you to leverage this mentor or not. I am a very independent person. [chuckles] So I did almost everything by myself. Sometimes, when we had our meetings, I was like, “What do you think of my proposal?” “Is it relevant or not?” And then he would be like, “Yeah, it's interesting. You can go ahead with it.” That's practically much of our meeting. [chuckles] That's what I do in our meeting. Well, apart from that, there is the PhD Fellowship Summit that I invite you to – it's a virtual Summit, where obviously, there are all of the Google PhD fellows gathered together. Then Googlers talk about what they're doing in Google, in the research aspect – obviously, about AI. Interesting. You mentioned that one of the reasons you got this was the cause, and that it was helping the local community. [Sara agrees] Not only that, but also, because of all the previous work you had done – all the volunteering work, and that you applied the AI to a lot of things. Can you maybe tell us more about that? What kind of volunteering work have you done? My first volunteering work was with Omdena – it was around the detection of post-traumatic stress disorder. In that project, we kind of, as always… I'm not sure if you know this, but in AI, most of the time, we have the problem with data – we have the problem of computational resources. We didn't have the data at the time. We kind of had to get creative regarding where we got it from. We were a bunch of AI engineers collaborating together to help figure out from certain discussions if a person had PTSD or not. We developed a chatbot for that. For example, if we believed that that person had post traumatic stress disorder, we suggested resources based on DSM-5 and CAPS-5 (these are standard psychiatric guidelines that we referred to). Obviously, most of the time, we always refer them to the doctor, because with AI, you can never trust it.  This is one of the points. Apart from that, from then on, I started volunteering with Omdena more. I actually volunteered with their second project about trash out, which was about detecting if a certain trash is recyclable or not, using computer vision. For example, you have some kind of trash, and then you figure out if it's recyclable or not. Because every region in the world has its own regulations, on top of figuring out if it was recyclable or not, we had to figure it out… It depends on what type of actual trash it is, depending on the region. That was my second project with Omdena. My third project was with Fruit Punch AI, and it was around detecting our cervicals. In our spine, we have curved because seven cervicals and we had to segment those. What they wanted us to do was to segment these cervicals so that they could actually plot a searching function where they… They tried to know if this movement that I'm doing right now is normal. If it is a normal movement. In the neck only, right? Yeah. Yes. They were trying to figure out if… For example, when someone had surgery to replace one of these cervicals, was the movement still the same as it is in normal settings? Because, what happened was that, when they replaced one of these cervicals, the “meat” kind of sticks to the new cervicals, and the neck doesn't move as normally as it could. So they wanted to know what the difference was? What was the factor that was helping us do all of this movement, and figuring out a solution for that.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'So, we run sample data through the pipeline and check if the output matches our expectations? Yes, that’s snapshot testing. If you prepare the input data and know what to expect, you can name the tests according to the business rules they’re testing. It’s like test-driven development but not in the same order. If your data pipeline is a Python script using pandas, it’s relatively easy to test. You can create functions and test them with unit tests. For Spark jobs, it’s less straightforward, but you can isolate functions like UDFs. Are there tools that work for all data pipelines, or how do you choose the tools? I work with Spark, so I configure the pipeline externally and switch between production and test environments. I’m not aware of tools for every type of pipeline, but Spark works for me. At my previous company, we used SQL queries, which were harder to test. We used tools like Great Expectations and Soda to define checks and run them after each pipeline step. These checks included things like the number of columns or ensuring no null values. Those are basic tests. If you’re doing a join and missing columns, you can catch errors. Great Expectations is one tool for this. For SQL, you can use templating to replace table names with test tables. Would you recommend Spark for new projects, or would you choose something else? I’d use Spark because I’m familiar with it. If your team knows Spark, it’s still a great tool. If not, there are many tutorials to learn from. Spark is here to stay, at least for some time. In our data engineering course, we still teach Spark. Companies still use it, but I wonder if it’s chosen for new projects. Sometimes, it’s easier to write SQL queries and run them on BigQuery or Snowflake. At a previous company, we built an MLOps platform and used Spark for processing logs. It was a new project, and even though most developers had no Spark experience, it was still the easiest solution. We’ve talked a lot about data engineering. Now, let’s talk about AI. How is data engineering connected to AI tools and LLMs? First, you can use AI in your pipeline, but it might not be the smartest idea because of hallucinations. You’ll have many bugs to fix. Another connection is fine-tuning models. You need a lot of data, and data engineers preprocess it. Even if you’re doing backend work, you’ll have logs to analyze. Data engineers are always needed, though the scale varies. I was also curious about your journey. How did you switch from data engineering to focusing more on AI? Was it something you liked, or was it something you needed to work on and learn? How did it happen for you? I wanted to switch to data science from backend engineering but ended up in data engineering. Still, I wanted to do some machine learning, so I was kind of in between those two areas. Then, I moved into MLOps, which was what I wanted to do. It combined data engineering, machine learning, and some backend work I was familiar with. So, it was passion-driven? You wanted to do it, saw the opportunity, and thought, “This is something I want to try”? Yes, you could say that. I was also not very satisfied with backend engineering anymore, so I wanted to try something new. Can you tell us about some use cases of AI that you’ve worked on? Of course, the typical use case is augmented generation. You have a database, and you use AI to generate content. But I think the most interesting use cases are when you don’t even see that AI is involved. For example, I worked on a project where we analyzed Google reviews for a company. The goal was to find out what worked and what didn’t at specific locations and generate a report. The AI was used in the background to analyze the data, but it wasn’t presented to the user as an AI feature. There was no “Summarize with AI” button. It just made the report more useful. I think this is the most useful way to use AI—don’t show everyone you’re using it, just make the product better. But marketing-wise, if you show people you use AI, it’s easier to attract investment and users. It might be easier to attract investment, but is it easier to attract users? There are two camps: people who love everything with AI and people who absolutely hate it. I live in Berlin, and now when I take the subway, I see banners like “Samsung with AI.” Everything needs AI now, apparently. But do users need it? They might need it, but do they need to know they’re using it? Machine learning models have been around in mobile phones for quite some time, right? Exactly. If you’re using an app where you can type something to search for pictures, that’s using machine learning to recognize what’s in the picture. But you don’t have to tell people it’s AI. It’s just a feature that works. Google does advertise their cameras with AI. I guess their marketing department knows what they’re doing. Probably. But saying something is built with AI is like saying it was built with Spark. It’s just supposed to work. You’ve written a lot of posts—480, you said. One of them was about prompt engineering. Can you tell us more about the content of that post and what exactly makes a good prompt? It depends on the model, but there are a few things that almost always work. One is called in-context learning, which is a fancy name for giving the model examples. This works because you’re showing the model what’s supposed to happen in a similar case, so it can imitate the response. This is especially useful if you need a specific format, like JSON with certain keys. Another technique is chain-of-thought prompting, but with reasoning models, it’s often built-in now.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"I guess if you like these posts about relevant opportunities, then LinkedIn will surface suggestions next time you open it. Yes, suggestions and recommendations. Sure. Yeah. By the way, Facebook is a great place to find opportunities as well. But please, don't follow irrelevant people and think that you will get anything interesting from that. Try to see where, for example, it's about specifically the topic you’re interested in. For example, for me, I'm interested in computer vision – let's say in health care for now, I will only join Facebook groups that talk about that specifically. And I will make sure that it's not a Facebook group that is full of irrelevant posts. Sometimes it can be about a topic, but it has nothing to do with what they're posting about. I noticed that what Twitter recently started doing is – in addition to people who I follow, they also started mixing in popular content. [Sara agrees] Which is things like puppy videos, or things from movies or quotes or whatever. And ads – lots of ads. And ads, yeah. But, I mean, everyone is trying to rip some money off people. That's why, I guess, they're being like that. I mean, ads, I understand. Ads are sometimes relevant, right? If the algorithm is good, then they show relevant ads. Okay. I don't mind that. But puppy videos? It’s like they just want to get me to stay on the platform. Who doesn't like puppies, right? Yeah. [chuckles] Just be careful how much time you spend there. Twitter is a great place if you're a researcher because most researchers hang out there. That their fabulous place – at least it used to be. Well, I remember Yann LeCun once wrote, “I'm leaving Twitter. I'll never come back.” Yes, yes. It was the mastodon era. Yeah, but he's still there. Right? [chuckles] Okay. So this is how you found these opportunities – through social media. So you found Omdena, then you took part in another challenge with Omdena, and then there was this FruitPunch.AI, which is a similar platform, right? Or what was that? Yes, it's just that the setting is a little bit different. For example, Omdena gathers all of us AI engineers together and leaves… We do have meetings, but it leaves the freedom for us to work on what we want, or what is relevant to what we want to achieve. But for Fruit Punch AI, it's more structured. For example, they have a team for every task – they're the ones describing the task very specifically and then if you want to join a specific task, it's already a task there. You don't have to come up with the task yourself. So Omdena just gives you a general problem [Sara agrees] and then it's up to you how exactly to approach this and what kind of tasks you have. While at Fruit Punch AI, it's more structured like you would have at work. Somebody could be a sort of “product manager” or a business person who translates the requirements. Yeah, they are the ones who do that. They are the ones who translate the requirements – they define the problem into actual specific tasks. At Omdena, they tell you, “Here's a problem. Here are parts of the problem that we want to solve. Here are our objectives.” But in terms of who is going to do what, what the specific tasks are, and everything like that, it's up to the AI engineers to figure it out. But then I think it's because of the public. Fruit Punch AI, they really target people who are still beginners, but for Omdena, they target people who are already advanced. You have to have done at least two to three projects in AI in order to be able to really navigate the challenge. Because it's really hard when you have a lot of experts around you and you're intimidated to do anything if you're not familiar with AI. Does that mean that if I'm a beginner, I cannot take part in Omdena challenges? You can! That's the thing, you can. They won't block you. [chuckles] It’s just that it’s going to be very overwhelming. But people usually are very nice. If you're not shy, and if you ask for help, everyone will most surely help. People are really nice – everyone is willing to help and ready to help. Okay. Let's say I want to join a challenge – a similar challenge from Omdena, from Fruit Punch AI, from something else, from some other company. Join us! [chuckles] “You” who? AI Wonder Girls! Okay, tell us more about that. We're a group of ladies interested in AI, from different walks of life. There are people who are tech and people who are business-related. We get together and we find a challenge that's interesting for us –a hackathon, competition, you name it. We get together and then work on it. That's it! No, that's not… [cross-talk] Nothing fancy. What are you working on right now? Yeah. Well, right now, I'm not sure if any of us… Because we have a bunch… The name is the same but we have different teams. Any team can – you get at least five ladies together, or three, and then we should do something interesting. There are people who are interested in health care, like me. [chuckles] Most of them, there's something related to health care. I share the link in our WhatsApp group and I'm like, “Ladies are you in? Who's in?” And then we get together, we pump up our first meeting, figure out what they want from us – from a challenge or the hackathon. Obviously, one of the things we really care about is judging criteria. We figure that out first. Then we figure out what they are interested in us helping them solve. Then we brainstorm together, we come up with a couple ideas to explore, we gather data around it. Is it feasible? If it's feasible, we move on and then we start coding. If it's not, then, obviously, we move on to the next idea until we find what we're looking for. We have won a couple of challenges. Actually, from the day we started, we kept winning until now – sometimes we don't win. [chuckles] I have so many questions about winning and challenges. But I want to take a step back. Go ahead. Go ahead.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"That was my third project. Then like all the other projects that came after that were related to my internship, where I started to do it… It was an online internship – this was my first online internship ever [chuckles] with STEM-Away. Actually, we had to figure out what type of topic a certain post can go to. So when you have a couple of forums like, for example, Stack Overflow, Stack Exchange – you have people discussing a lot of topics. So, for example, you might have someone saying a certain discussion and you might want to classify which topic this might be for. For example, if it’s AI, is it computer vision, is it using deep learning, or something like that? So that was what the internship was about. I started being a mentor from an intern – from a project lead to a mentor in that setting, and then creating content for people to learn AI. That's amazing, so many… Going back to this Omdena – the first project was about detecting PTSD and you implemented a chatbot for that, right? [Sara agrees] I imagine… Where can you even get the data about that? Oh, so we got it from… Someone  in the university had a friend in the military, and they contacted them, and they said we could use that data. At that time, if I remember correctly, IBM was interested in developing chatbots for military people. Because, mostly, they are the ones who suffer most from PTSD. I mean, they go through traumatic events almost every day. So they were interested in developing a machine learning model and that's why the data was available. So we can say we struck luck. But, for example, for the Trash Out, what we did was… We already had some data. But, obviously, if you're doing segmentation, you need more data [chuckles] than, for example, just a couple… 100 is not enough, right? What we did was leverage open images – there's a huge [cache] of Google open source open images. What we did was pick the trash from that. We picked trash from Google images. We kind of had to get creative around how to collect data. This is what happens in every volunteering challenge I have entered. Normally, this happens with people who… Even businesses that can't afford to buy data – they get their own data from somewhere. So you have to get creative around where you can find that data. In research, this happens a lot, especially if you don't have funding. It's hard to find data. How did you actually come across this project from Omdena? How did you find this PTSD project (the first one)? That's a good question. From my LinkedIn. [chuckles] When I was back in my first year, the one where I discovered that I was interested in AI, the whole time, I was complaining about opportunity. When I got into AI, I was really… I knew I needed to get a PhD or a Master’s, so I can further my studies and develop the skills. Because what we had in Morocco was still kind of… We didn't have experts. We had only a few people who actually knew about AI and mastered it. So I needed to get more expertise, and I wanted to go abroad. One of the things I was always complaining about was, “Why do we not have opportunities to further our studies and get funding and scholarships, and all of that?” So what I developed was a kind of reflex of searching for opportunities. Right now, I use my Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn just for opportunities hunting. Whenever I see someone posting something interesting – that's why I actually send a lot of LinkedIn requests. I have people from all over the world with different opportunities that they post from time to time. You can think of it like a task or habit now – I scroll everyday through all of my LinkedIn feed (or Facebook feed) for an opportunity. Although now I kind of know where the treasure trove is, thanks to the mailing lists. [chuckles] So it's easier to get opportunities. But before, that's how I actually got across LinkedIn, by… Actually the Omdena thing by Rudradeb (his name is a bit difficult to pronounce). He is the founder of Omdena. He was posting about his… I believe it was their second challenge, where they were detecting rooftops. That's how I learned about Omdena, and I was like, “Yeah, sure. It will be interesting to use my skills and help in that way.” And that's how I came across the PTSD challenge. Okay. So, social media, right? You follow relevant… People. Interesting people. Yes. And they post relevant stuff and you follow on that – you connect with them and you ask, “Hey, I want to take part.” Right? [Sara agrees] That's cool. But can’t… Sometimes, for me, when I open LinkedIn, it can be a bit overwhelming. Yeah, it is. That's why you kind of need to be very specific around who you follow. You need to be mindful… [cross-talk] And what you like, right? Yes. And you need to be mindful of how much time you're spending. For example, for me… Actually, to be honest, I developed the bad habit of scrolling. Not just scrolling, for example, sometimes I'm just holding my phone. I'm always doing this [shows thumb scrolling motion]. Scrolling, right? One time, I was reading a book – this was around during startup. I was on a train, and I wanted to move to the next page. So instead of turning the page… [chuckles] It didn’t work, right? [chuckles] Yeah, you know – it's a bad habit. Right now, what I'm doing is cutting off all social media from my phone. But I check them out on my laptop. Usually, my laptop is only for work. So if I do it, I do it only for five to ten minutes, and then go out to do my work. [chuckles] I guess if you like these posts about relevant opportunities, then LinkedIn will surface suggestions next time you open it. Yes, suggestions and recommendations. Sure. Yeah. By the way, Facebook is a great place to find opportunities as well. But please, don't follow irrelevant people and think that you will get anything interesting from that. Try to see where, for example, it's about specifically the topic you’re interested in. For example, for me, I'm interested in computer vision – let's say in health care for now, I will only join Facebook groups that talk about that specifically. And I will make sure that it's not a Facebook group that is full of irrelevant posts. Sometimes it can be about a topic, but it has nothing to do with what they're posting about. I noticed that what Twitter recently started doing is – in addition to people who I follow, they also started mixing in popular content. [Sara agrees] Which is things like puppy videos, or things from movies or quotes or whatever. And ads – lots of ads. And ads, yeah. But, I mean, everyone is trying to rip some money off people. That's why, I guess, they're being like that. I mean, ads, I understand. Ads are sometimes relevant, right? If the algorithm is good, then they show relevant ads. Okay. I don't mind that. But puppy videos? It’s like they just want to get me to stay on the platform. Who doesn't like puppies, right? Yeah. [chuckles] Just be careful how much time you spend there. Twitter is a great place if you're a researcher because most researchers hang out there. That their fabulous place – at least it used to be. Well, I remember Yann LeCun once wrote, “I'm leaving Twitter. I'll never come back.” Yes, yes. It was the mastodon era. Yeah, but he's still there. Right? [chuckles] Okay. So this is how you found these opportunities – through social media. So you found Omdena, then you took part in another challenge with Omdena, and then there was this FruitPunch.AI, which is a similar platform, right? Or what was that? Yes, it's just that the setting is a little bit different. For example, Omdena gathers all of us AI engineers together and leaves… We do have meetings, but it leaves the freedom for us to work on what we want, or what is relevant to what we want to achieve. But for Fruit Punch AI, it's more structured. For example, they have a team for every task – they're the ones describing the task very specifically and then if you want to join a specific task, it's already a task there. You don't have to come up with the task yourself. So Omdena just gives you a general problem [Sara agrees] and then it's up to you how exactly to approach this and what kind of tasks you have. While at Fruit Punch AI, it's more structured like you would have at work. Somebody could be a sort of “product manager” or a business person who translates the requirements. Yeah, they are the ones who do that. They are the ones who translate the requirements – they define the problem into actual specific tasks. At Omdena, they tell you, “Here's a problem. Here are parts of the problem that we want to solve. Here are our objectives.” But in terms of who is going to do what, what the specific tasks are, and everything like that, it's up to the AI engineers to figure it out. But then I think it's because of the public. Fruit Punch AI, they really target people who are still beginners, but for Omdena, they target people who are already advanced. You have to have done at least two to three projects in AI in order to be able to really navigate the challenge. Because it's really hard when you have a lot of experts around you and you're intimidated to do anything if you're not familiar with AI.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'Yes, you could say that. I was also not very satisfied with backend engineering anymore, so I wanted to try something new. Can you tell us about some use cases of AI that you’ve worked on? Of course, the typical use case is augmented generation. You have a database, and you use AI to generate content. But I think the most interesting use cases are when you don’t even see that AI is involved. For example, I worked on a project where we analyzed Google reviews for a company. The goal was to find out what worked and what didn’t at specific locations and generate a report. The AI was used in the background to analyze the data, but it wasn’t presented to the user as an AI feature. There was no “Summarize with AI” button. It just made the report more useful. I think this is the most useful way to use AI—don’t show everyone you’re using it, just make the product better. But marketing-wise, if you show people you use AI, it’s easier to attract investment and users. It might be easier to attract investment, but is it easier to attract users? There are two camps: people who love everything with AI and people who absolutely hate it. I live in Berlin, and now when I take the subway, I see banners like “Samsung with AI.” Everything needs AI now, apparently. But do users need it? They might need it, but do they need to know they’re using it? Machine learning models have been around in mobile phones for quite some time, right? Exactly. If you’re using an app where you can type something to search for pictures, that’s using machine learning to recognize what’s in the picture. But you don’t have to tell people it’s AI. It’s just a feature that works. Google does advertise their cameras with AI. I guess their marketing department knows what they’re doing. Probably. But saying something is built with AI is like saying it was built with Spark. It’s just supposed to work. You’ve written a lot of posts—480, you said. One of them was about prompt engineering. Can you tell us more about the content of that post and what exactly makes a good prompt? It depends on the model, but there are a few things that almost always work. One is called in-context learning, which is a fancy name for giving the model examples. This works because you’re showing the model what’s supposed to happen in a similar case, so it can imitate the response. This is especially useful if you need a specific format, like JSON with certain keys. Another technique is chain-of-thought prompting, but with reasoning models, it’s often built-in now. There are also prompting tricks, like saying “step by step” or offering a tip like “$100 for doing it right.” These are more like hacks that might work once for a specific model. Proper prompt engineering is more about providing examples and explaining how things are supposed to happen. This works for all models, though some might perform better than others. Is prompt engineering becoming less important for models like GPT-4 compared to GPT-3.5? GPT-3.5 was good but not as good as GPT-4, so we needed to spend more time crafting prompts. Now, it feels like GPT-4 just gets it. It gets it, but if it doesn’t, you can either describe it in detail or provide an example. Examples work better. This is the in-context learning technique, which is essentially prompt engineering. We just gave it a fancy name. Can you give us an example of how to provide an example? Sure. Let’s say you’re analyzing the sentiment of a sentence. You have one review that’s positive and another that’s negative. You need the output in a specific format, like JSON. You can either explain, “Give me valid JSON with this key,” or you can provide an example of a review and the corresponding JSON output. The model will follow the format even if you don’t explicitly say, “I need JSON with this key.” But the bigger the prompt, the more money we pay. How many examples should we include? For sentiment analysis, is it enough to include one positive and one negative example? Or do we need more? If we do this at scale, including more examples in the prompt could become expensive. Yes, and that’s why I would recommend testing—or rather, gathering data from tests. You prepare an evaluation dataset with inputs and expected outputs, then measure how well the model performs. At some point, when you keep adding examples, the results will stop improving, so you can stop there. I recently discovered a part of AI engineering called prompt compression. Apparently, you can remove some tokens from the prompt, and the model will still perform the same. I can’t explain it yet because I’m still reading about it, but it’s interesting. Is it related to prompt caching? I don’t know how it works internally, but— I think it’s not related. In prompt compression, you create a different prompt that’s shorter but supposed to do the same thing. It’s about creating an equivalent prompt with fewer tokens, possibly dropping parts of the words or something like that. So, it’s like asking ChatGPT, “Hey, I have this prompt. Can you rewrite it to make it shorter but not lose any meaningful parts?” Maybe. I don’t know how it works internally yet, but I imagine it might be something like that. I don’t know how prompt caching works either, but I know that Anthropic’s models, like Claude, have it. It makes coding tasks cheaper because you don’t send the entire codebase every time. For example, with Codex, they cache part of the prompt, so you pay less.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"Yeah, open source chatbot company. Essentially, you don't know what you will find in the subject because it depends on implementation. Even the schema is not really fixed. So we needed a way to manage a very volatile schema, but also be able to freeze it if we wanted to. I heard that many people want to go to consulting, to freelancing, but they don't want to do it forever. Because here, you exchange time for money, but at some point, maybe you just want to get money without spending time. [chuckles] Is this usually what freelancers do at the end? They see a problem that is repeated many times, so they end up packaging it as a product and then sell it as a product? Some people, yes – because they get bored. But each person has their own ambitions and approaches. Some people simply go three days a week and enjoy a richer life. Other people start companies, other people don't care, and just work like that. Other people put all their money in Bitcoin and cash out enough to retire. No joke. One of my mentees in freelancing did that. Yeah, every person has their own dreams and ambitions. When did he invest in Bitcoin? Like in 2012? I don't really want to talk about his finances, but he took it when he was a freelancer and I think he invested in January before last year. [cross-talk] It was already expensive then, right? Yeah, so I think he went like 3 or 5X or something and he cashed it out in Portugal, where he didn't have to pay tax. So he moved smart. As a freelancer you can do that. [chuckles] Okay, thanks. We have a bunch of other questions. Would you recommend building a portfolio to showcase your skill and for reaching out to new customers? I recommend building a portfolio of products you can reuse, and basically do it again for other customers. That's going to be efficient. Because in my experience, if customers like you and you tell them that you can do it, then they will give you a shot. [cross-talk] This tool that you're developing is one of such things, right? If somebody has a problem, then you can say, “Hey, you know what? I actually have a solution for you. Let's give it a try. This is the solution. I can implement it for you, if you want.” And typically, they will agree. Right? Exactly. For example, this tool that I'm talking about for data loading – I'm personally using it to create really good pipelines. But it's also usable by someone that doesn't want to create really good pipelines, but just wants to throw some stuff in a database. If a client wants it done commercial-grade, and with a nice DBT package on top of that, it has iterative [cross-talk]. It’s cross-database compatible and all the nice stuff with rebuilding states, having a nice schema. For example, for us, we even inject templates into my database through the API. So yeah, if you want something like that, of course, it's not open source anymore. [chuckles] [cross-talk] But still, you want to show them that you can solve their problems as quickly as possible, right? Yeah. Okay. But I guess a portfolio is a good start anyways, right? If you don't have a portfolio of reusable things, a portfolio with projects you solved is already good enough. The question is “Who are you talking to? I think if you go through agencies like Hayes, then you will probably be talking to a technical person that is hiring you – then maybe a portfolio is useful. If you are talking directly to your clients, then chances are that those might be business people or people that already know you, and then they won't care about your portfolio. Personally, I talk to the second type of people. Okay. Got it. There’s another question, “Is freelancing better suited for extroverts or can introverts also do this?” I'm an introvert, so I would say if you're an extrovert – that is a nice bonus. What you need to do is just not get in your own way. Ultimately, you're the only person who can stop you. When we were talking about exchanging time for money, you said that not everyone wants the same thing. Some people want to work less. Is it feasible to, let's say, work for three months per year or is it too little? Is it even possible? Are there companies who are interested in this kind of stuff? [cross-talk] I would say that I've had projects that I could run either between one and three days a week, or one and four – four days is already considered full time. Some projects might run a week, if it's just a small project helping someone with something. It might run for a year… Ultimately, you can also say you've had enough after three months, or you can keep going until it’s over. But would it be enough money, income-wise, if I just worked three months per year? Or probably not? If you’re working three months per year and only taking the projects that are paying you a decent enough rate – so let's say 120 multiplied by eight, that's like 1000 per day, multiplied by 60 for three months. So I would say 60k. If you live in Germany, you probably have to pay about a third of that as taxes, subtract health insurance, or about 10k. But that's the max if you earn 55k. You're left with I think 30,000, which is actually very comfortable. Outside of Berlin, right? If you live in Berlin, then you spend most of the money on rent. I bought my apartment almost eight years ago, so I'm not entirely sure. [laughs] Oh, okay. You’re lucky. You said that now you're not actively looking for new projects. But at some point, you were looking for new projects and you said you always wanted to leave some room for learning. In this case, do you have a strategy between deciding which project to take and which skills to learn next? I would say I don't necessarily have a skill strategy. It's also very much about what I like to do. Because by being a generalist, I already have such a broad array of skills that finding work is not a problem. Being a specialist doesn't necessarily help me either find more work or do that work much better. So I really go by interest. So interest can be – interest in technology, or interest in a domain, or interest in working with specific people, right? It doesn't matter. Okay. How can I check if freelancing is for me? Let's say I have a full time job and I hear this conversation – it all sounds nice, like working three months per year, doing all that, developing the product, and then selling it for millions. This is all good in my imagination, but how can I check if it's actually for me? I can tell you about the people who probably managed freelancing successfully and why they failed. I think if you're that kind of person, maybe it's not the best option for you. There are two types of people that fail, the ones that don't put themselves out there because they think “Oh, it's fine, I will find the work when I need it.” But you need to build a network and then this is not a deterministic action, like “If you do this, this will happen.” It might happen and it might not, so you need to keep at it. The second thing is – you definitely need to ask for a decent rate. If you're too afraid to ask for a good rate, if you are asking for the equivalent of a salary or something like that, then you will fail because you won't be able to make ends meet due to the added risk and occupancy rate and all that. You said a good occupancy rate is 75%?\"},\n",

You said a good occupancy rate is 75%? Yeah. So it means that you work only 75% of the year? It means you will be working 1700 hours. And you don't control when you work and when you don't, right? A project might end, it might take two weeks to find a new project. So during these two weeks, you're not working. Yes. In all honesty, I've only really had downtime when we had the first Corona wave and everybody panicked and they cut all the contracts. [cross-talk] Yeah, I think you said that the market is different right now. On the topic of Berlin, there is a question about Berlin – Is the market in Berlin currently good for freelancers in terms of pay opportunities and everything? Yes, but you need to put yourself out there and make your own opportunities. If you're going to wait for the few projects that come at you, then you will compete with the other people who are doing the same. So unless you're as good or better than them, it's going to be hard. But I would say that one of the most important things when taking a freelancing job is to be available. I think you will find something. Okay. In terms of expectations from clients – let's say if we compare a full time employee from a company and a freelancer, would a company expect more from a freelancer in terms of being more proactive, driving decision making, coming up with architectural proposals, or not? Or is all of that in this ‘scope of work document’ that you mentioned? I would say that people are people, so it really depends. I'm the kind of person that does get involved – I just can't let it go. Other people, even as employees, you have to beg them to do their thing. They don't get involved, they're not proactive, and so on. I would say if you are a proactive person that wants to get stuff done, you will get access to the best clients and the best rates. Again, just to make it clear, by proactive, you mean what? You said “putting yourself out there,” and by that you mean – networking with people, keeping in touch with past clients or what exactly? I mean, you don't necessarily need to keep in touch with past clients. But yes, keep networking, maintain a healthy network, when you work, make sure you care. Actually care about the outcome of the project, care that it's a good outcome for the client – a good outcome for the client sometimes might be that the client is happy and not necessarily what you think is a good outcome. But if you actually do what people want, help them, and advise them, then they will usually find this so invaluable that they will want to keep working with you all the time. What do you think about working for two clients simultaneously? Does it make sense? Does it just happen? Some people advise you to do that simply to not put all your eggs in one basket. I would say – yeah, don't put all your eggs in one basket and have some savings. Focus is important, and if you want to do a good job, I think it's best that you do focus. It might also depend on you, if you have the capacity to do multiple clients. I like to usually have one main client and one side client that is small enough, just for some extra learning or networking. Sometimes I take these small projects just for enlarging the network. But otherwise, I would say just focus on one. If you want to make the best money, just focus on one. How does this look in practice? Let's say you spend around three days on your main client, one day on your other client, and one day chilling on the beach?\"},\n",

No, no, I'm finished. I haven't done any experimentation for almost a year. Yeah. So you've been writing papers for a year? No, it’s more like I have been writing papers from the start of my PhD. My first paper was ready by… I believe it was November or something. It was ready, as it was circulating around journals. Because, by the way, the paper that was published just recently, just last year and this was the first paper that was written, all the other papers that have already been published, but it was still roaming around. Ah, so it took a bit of time. [Sara agrees] You're also a Google PhD fellow. [Sara agrees] What does that mean and how did you get it? Yeah. Actually, one of the things we don't have in Morocco, sadly, for now – we don't have funding for research. One of the things I had to do was find a funding source – a scholarship or something to help me support my studies. Way before that, I was involved in a lot of Google stuff, like with the GDG (Google Developers Groups). I knew they had a program called Google PhD Fellowship. I applied to it. I… What can I tell you? The thing is, if you want to apply for aid and you want to have a chance to be selected, please make sure that you focus on something they care about. For example, try to figure out what they're researching, especially, for example, a searching field – if you're doing it for healthcare. Figure out what they're interested in. Then the second thing is, it has to touch upon a SDG goal, like helping you or your community. And it has to help your community. That means if you're in Morocco, or if you're in a certain region, it has to help your region do something – it's going to be useful if people leverage that research or something. I think that's why I got it, but I believe strongly that most of the reasons why I really got it was not just around the proposal, but also, obviously, my supervisor. And the second thing is all of the works I have already done way before applying to it. I have done a lot of volunteer work; I have touched a lot – I've been [involved with] all kinds of different AI and applied it to different domains. So I think that's one of the reasons why I got it. So what is it all about? Usually, in the fellowship – you can think of it like a scholarship because it kind of is like a scholarship. They give you money, right? For example $10,000 per year. By the way, they increased that – now it's $12,000. But usually it’s $10,000 a year for three years, depending on the region. For example, Africa, this is what we have. I believe in the US, they only give them for one year, because usually they do have funding. What do they give you on top of the money, is they also give you a Google mentor and it's up to you to leverage this mentor or not. I am a very independent person. [chuckles] So I did almost everything by myself. Sometimes, when we had our meetings, I was like, “What do you think of my proposal?” “Is it relevant or not?” And then he would be like, “Yeah, it's interesting. You can go ahead with it.” That's practically much of our meeting. [chuckles] That's what I do in our meeting. Well, apart from that, there is the PhD Fellowship Summit that I invite you to – it's a virtual Summit, where obviously, there are all of the Google PhD fellows gathered together. Then Googlers talk about what they're doing in Google, in the research aspect – obviously, about AI. Interesting. You mentioned that one of the reasons you got this was the cause, and that it was helping the local community. [Sara agrees] Not only that, but also, because of all the previous work you had done – all the volunteering work, and that you applied the AI to a lot of things. Can you maybe tell us more about that? What kind of volunteering work have you done? My first volunteering work was with Omdena – it was around the detection of post-traumatic stress disorder. In that project, we kind of, as always… I'm not sure if you know this, but in AI, most of the time, we have the problem with data – we have the problem of computational resources. We didn't have the data at the time. We kind of had to get creative regarding where we got it from. We were a bunch of AI engineers collaborating together to help figure out from certain discussions if a person had PTSD or not. We developed a chatbot for that. For example, if we believed that that person had post traumatic stress disorder, we suggested resources based on DSM-5 and CAPS-5 (these are standard psychiatric guidelines that we referred to). Obviously, most of the time, we always refer them to the doctor, because with AI, you can never trust it.  This is one of the points. Apart from that, from then on, I started volunteering with Omdena more. I actually volunteered with their second project about trash out, which was about detecting if a certain trash is recyclable or not, using computer vision. For example, you have some kind of trash, and then you figure out if it's recyclable or not. Because every region in the world has its own regulations, on top of figuring out if it was recyclable or not, we had to figure it out… It depends on what type of actual trash it is, depending on the region. That was my second project with Omdena. My third project was with Fruit Punch AI, and it was around detecting our cervicals. In our spine, we have curved because seven cervicals and we had to segment those. What they wanted us to do was to segment these cervicals so that they could actually plot a searching function where they… They tried to know if this movement that I'm doing right now is normal. If it is a normal movement. In the neck only, right? Yeah. Yes. They were trying to figure out if… For example, when someone had surgery to replace one of these cervicals, was the movement still the same as it is in normal settings? Because, what happened was that, when they replaced one of these cervicals, the “meat” kind of sticks to the new cervicals, and the neck doesn't move as normally as it could. So they wanted to know what the difference was? What was the factor that was helping us do all of this movement, and figuring out a solution for that. That was my third project. Then like all the other projects that came after that were related to my internship, where I started to do it… It was an online internship – this was my first online internship ever [chuckles] with STEM-Away. Actually, we had to figure out what type of topic a certain post can go to. So when you have a couple of forums like, for example, Stack Overflow, Stack Exchange – you have people discussing a lot of topics. So, for example, you might have someone saying a certain discussion and you might want to classify which topic this might be for. For example, if it’s AI, is it computer vision, is it using deep learning, or something like that? So that was what the internship was about. I started being a mentor from an intern – from a project lead to a mentor in that setting, and then creating content for people to learn AI. That's amazing, so many… Going back to this Omdena – the first project was about detecting PTSD and you implemented a chatbot for that, right? [Sara agrees] I imagine… Where can you even get the data about that? Oh, so we got it from… Someone  in the university had a friend in the military, and they contacted them, and they said we could use that data. At that time, if I remember correctly, IBM was interested in developing chatbots for military people. Because, mostly, they are the ones who suffer most from PTSD. I mean, they go through traumatic events almost every day. So they were interested in developing a machine learning model and that's why the data was available. So we can say we struck luck. But, for example, for the Trash Out, what we did was… We already had some data. But, obviously, if you're doing segmentation, you need more data [chuckles] than, for example, just a couple… 100 is not enough, right? What we did was leverage open images – there's a huge [cache] of Google open source open images. What we did was pick the trash from that. We picked trash from Google images. We kind of had to get creative around how to collect data. This is what happens in every volunteering challenge I have entered. Normally, this happens with people who… Even businesses that can't afford to buy data – they get their own data from somewhere. So you have to get creative around where you can find that data. In research, this happens a lot, especially if you don't have funding. It's hard to find data. How did you actually come across this project from Omdena? How did you find this PTSD project (the first one)? That's a good question. From my LinkedIn. [chuckles] When I was back in my first year, the one where I discovered that I was interested in AI, the whole time, I was complaining about opportunity. When I got into AI, I was really… I knew I needed to get a PhD or a Master’s, so I can further my studies and develop the skills. Because what we had in Morocco was still kind of… We didn't have experts. We had only a few people who actually knew about AI and mastered it. So I needed to get more expertise, and I wanted to go abroad. One of the things I was always complaining about was, “Why do we not have opportunities to further our studies and get funding and scholarships, and all of that?” So what I developed was a kind of reflex of searching for opportunities. Right now, I use my Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn just for opportunities hunting. Whenever I see someone posting something interesting – that's why I actually send a lot of LinkedIn requests. I have people from all over the world with different opportunities that they post from time to time. You can think of it like a task or habit now – I scroll everyday through all of my LinkedIn feed (or Facebook feed) for an opportunity. Although now I kind of know where the treasure trove is, thanks to the mailing lists. [chuckles] So it's easier to get opportunities. But before, that's how I actually got across LinkedIn, by… Actually the Omdena thing by Rudradeb (his name is a bit difficult to pronounce). He is the founder of Omdena. He was posting about his… I believe it was their second challenge, where they were detecting rooftops. That's how I learned about Omdena, and I was like, “Yeah, sure. It will be interesting to use my skills and help in that way.” And that's how I came across the PTSD challenge. Okay. So, social media, right? You follow relevant… People. Interesting people. Yes. And they post relevant stuff and you follow on that – you connect with them and you ask, “Hey, I want to take part.” Right? [Sara agrees] That's cool. But can’t… Sometimes, for me, when I open LinkedIn, it can be a bit overwhelming. Yeah, it is. That's why you kind of need to be very specific around who you follow. You need to be mindful… [cross-talk] And what you like, right? Yes. And you need to be mindful of how much time you're spending. For example, for me… Actually, to be honest, I developed the bad habit of scrolling. Not just scrolling, for example, sometimes I'm just holding my phone. I'm always doing this [shows thumb scrolling motion]. Scrolling, right? One time, I was reading a book – this was around during startup. I was on a train, and I wanted to move to the next page. So instead of turning the page… [chuckles] It didn’t work, right? [chuckles] Yeah, you know – it's a bad habit. Right now, what I'm doing is cutting off all social media from my phone. But I check them out on my laptop. Usually, my laptop is only for work. So if I do it, I do it only for five to ten minutes, and then go out to do my work. [chuckles]\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"That's really up to you and how you like to work. To give you an example, there are multiple types of intermediaries. There could be a really big staffing agency like Hayes or Modis – essentially, what these guys do is just intermediate a transaction and you're interfacing with the client directly. This means that you can actually create relationships with the client and if you don't have your own relationships or other avenues – this is okay. It's probably one of the worst earning possibilities simply because these agencies often take a third of the project value and they do not negotiate good rates for you because they just want to sell the project. They don't care about your bottom line. So I would say that's fine if you don't have your own network – 80 per hour is still a lot. Would you suggest to somebody who is just getting started in freelancing to get in touch with Hayes or some other agency and work with them first? Absolutely. I think, if you want to be autonomous, that is a good way. An alternative for if you're just getting started would be to get in touch with smaller agencies as well. When it comes to smaller agencies, usually, they are expected to do project management as well, since they are the one selling a piece of work to the client. That means you need to sync with the agency and with the client. In my experience, this is harder because now you have two different personas that you need to make sure you understand well, and synchronize them. It's actually not my favorite way. If it was up to me, I would either go with something like Hayes because you're completely relaxed – they do the finding for you. Or with my personal clients. Your first project – was it from an agency? It was from such an agency, yes. And the second one? It was from the same agency. Okay, and at which point was it not from an agency, but from your own network? Well, I can give you a pretty simple history. This agency was actually paying me 60 to 70 per hour, which was quite low – even for the time. So I started looking on my own. At this time I had started to create a network – talk to people, to other freelancers, to potential clients. Essentially, at that point I was able to just answer to people coming back to me and ask for a higher rate. That’s when I stopped working with those agencies. Okay. So now you find new customers and projects without these agencies, right? Yes. But I will say that now, the market has also changed a little bit. If you have ‘freelance data engineer’ in your title on LinkedIn, you will get contacted a lot. So it changed in a good way. Right? It changed in a good way, yes. I think all these data scientists that have been in training for the last years have finally matured as professionals on the job market. And there is a lot of missing engineering to support. For someone who is a bit more generalist, it's a wonderful time. So how do you find new customers and projects now? Through your network? Now, I actually don't look for projects so much. Right now, for example, I was looking for what we call a ‘design partner,’ which is somebody that works closely with us and with this new tool that we're building in order to help us find bugs and use cases. For those people, yeah, through my network. Sometimes it’s asking people that I've worked with before, or even if I see like a new fitting project. But you said you still spend 20% of your time on consulting. How do you fill this 20%? Where do customers come from? The last customer actually came from my network and it was the third time around. He previously came as a customer on two separate projects. It's good to have a network, what can I say? When you network with other freelancers, it happens very often. If you have a good relationship (and by good relationship, I mean be a decent person, I don't mean sucking up) if you're a decent person and you can communicate well, then you will get follow-up work quite often. Okay. That sounds simple, right? Be a decent person. Be honest and communicate directly. I think the biggest fear for people is that you will create problems when they bring you in. One way to create problems is by not communicating directly and honestly. If you do communicate, usually everything can be resolved. How do you tell the clients that you will not create new problems for them? You listen. If you see that there are certain expectations and if you see that those expectations are at risk of not being met – I don't know, if your work is too slow due to whatever reasons, maybe it's you, maybe it's something else – communicate that ASAP. Manage expectations. Another thing I wanted to ask – you started as a freelancer, but now you say you do consulting for 20% of the work? What is the difference? In my opinion, from what I understood, freelancing is more often when you do the actual work yourself, but consulting is when you tell others what to do? Is this a correct explanation? In a way, yes. Practically, my experience has been that, by this definition, you're only purely a freelancer when you're coming through an agency. In any other situation, you're also doing the sale – So you’re consulting people, like “If you're in this stage, who's taking care of your stack? Then maybe you could use this or that.” It eventually ends up – well, now that you've told them what could be a solution that works, you could actually implement it for them or find something that can help them. So the lines are blurry, right? You can call yourself a consultant, but do everything as well. I guess the distinction is that – for me right now, due to the limited amount of time that I can spend with a topic, I'm not going to spin up your repository and do any programming, because it's just not feasible for me to change between yet another [inaudible]. Yeah. We have quite a few questions. One of the questions is, “When you talk to a company – to a potential customer – and they tell you about the problems and about the use cases, do you usually get enough clarity of what they expect from you before taking on a project? Or is it usually more vague like “Something is broken, and we don't know what to do.”?” It depends. “Something is broken, we don't know what to do,” is also clarity. Then you usually can try to create a scope of work document before starting the work because this helps you define and manage expectations. That scope of work might be that we do a spike for two weeks and identify all the problems and what we need to do as the next steps and we agree on that. Then we reassess after two weeks whether we're going to continue. What does the scope of work document look like? Is it a Google document with a description of a problem or something like that? I mean you can Google it, but the way that I do it is quite personal. I've gotten the feedback that it's quite specific. I like to put in as much detail of what goes into scope, what is not in scope, things about expectations, what they can expect also about working style and things like this – timelines as well.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"Do I understand correctly…? There's actually a question that reads, “What's the key to winning a hackathon?” So let me try to summarize what you said and then maybe we will add more. First of all, you have a mentor, and you need to get the most from this mentor to really understand what they want from you. These people will tell you what kind of things you need to do. Right? [Sara agrees] So they will help you understand the criteria. They will help you to understand what exactly you need to give at the end. Wait. By the way, they won't tell you. You need to get it out of them. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. Of course. So it's not like they just tell you “Oh, here. By the way, this is how you do this.” So you ask. You will tell us how to do this, but let me finish the summary. Then the second thing is, you don't focus on one single thing. Once you figure out, “Okay, this is the problem. This is the solution,” you then explore other solutions and you think, “Okay, there are two-three potential things we can do. How can we put them in one package – to form one solution from them?” And then you split into subgroups and work on these sub-solutions and then present it as a whole thing. So that's the key to winning – understanding requirements, talking to your mentors, and presenting multiple solutions. Is there anything else? What else would you add? Yeah. You can think of it like a business. In business, you obviously have clients, and you have an offer. Right? So one of the key criteria in business is to understand your client – to be able to provide them with the offer that is going to suit them, right? This is very similar in hackathons or challenges or anything you're doing. So you need to understand the judges. So what do the judges care about? You first need to know who they are, if it's possible. Otherwise, you need to read through the lines. What matters to these people? What is it that they are stressed about that you really want to get up? So this is the most crucial part. And you need to be very careful of the judging criteria. So what do they want? What are they going to be giving notes on? For example, if they care about inclusion – nice! In your presentation, make sure you leverage the fact that you're an amazing eight ladies from all over the world [chuckles] and working on AI. This is a winning point in one of the judging criteria, for example. So if they care about something specific – let's say they care about the environment – figure out a way to add environments to your solution. So figure out how to leverage what they're looking for, what they care about, as judges – as people – and then, as organizers of the hackathon. If you try to figure out what they want out of the hackathon, that's the best way to win – to understand what they want and deliver on it, as best you can. That's the winning criteria. That's smart. Is there something that most people miss? I guess if there is a list of criteria, then most people try to… “Okay, they care about the environment. Let's set something…” Is there something that most people miss? Yes. You don't? No, there is. There's one thing actually that we all miss. It's the fact that we say, “I can't do this.” So what I invite you to do is not to think about the fact that you can't do this, but think about what you can do with what you have. For example, let's say I want to build a model that detects if someone has hair loss or not through, for example, some kind of data from bio (not from images). It's difficult if you don't have the data. But what if you got creative around it? You really have to have that data? Isn't there some kind of other place where you can find similar data? Or you can… With LLMs right now, you can create your own data. Because what they're looking for is for you to show them that it's possible to be done. In a hackathon, they're not looking for the final solution. That's not possible. When you have one to two months, you can only come up with an MVP. Right? That's what you want to do. Focus on how you can build the MVP and don't think about, “I don't have the means.” For example, if you lack computational power, there is Goggle, there is Colab. Leverage the resources you have. Get creative around which you can build. This is one of the reasons why we usually fail in hackathons – people give up too early, because when they get into the solution, they're like, “Oh, my God! What did I get into? This is not possible to be done.” But that's not how you should approach it. So the state… The mindset. Right. The mindset should be not, “It's not possible,” but “How can I do something that brings me closer?” Right? And then it could be just maybe taking a step back and then exploring other ways to do this. Instead of getting data, you generate the data, or as you said… Or get it from social media, research papers… So what if I'm the least creative person on Earth? How do I go about being creative when it comes to getting data? That's a cool question. Well, thanks to generative AI, you have ChatGPT, you have Gemini, you have all kinds of AIs to help you get creative. You can just go around and say, “I want to build this solution.” Just tell it everything you have as a problem. “There is no data. I have never worked on this before. I only have experience with basic machine learning models. How can I win this hackathon with the following judgment criteria?” Give it all the descriptions and let it run wild. The only thing you have to do is pick the solution that you feel most comfortable with. Yeah. So, basically just tell the Chatbot all you know about the problem. Yes, sure. What do you want from it? This is just one way. If we didn't have AI, how can you do that? One of the best ways is… One of the things I forgot to talk about is your team. You need to pick the right people in your team. In your team, there is a need for someone to be creative. There is a need for someone to love doing things – someone who is going to build the actual solution. There is a need for someone who is a little bit technical – they don't have to 1000 percent know how to do it, but they at least have to know how to do something. So your team is one of your assets. If you can't, or if you're not creative, but you want to get ideas – simple. There are a couple of ways you can do it. First things first. You can go to Reddit, figure out what people mainly complain about in that subject area. Here you go. Here's your idea. There's a lot of complaints. Just pick the one that you find the most relatable to the hackathon or challenge or research. If you're doing research, by the way, this is the same thing. Whatever project you want to start, even a startup, go do some market research. Try to understand what people are complaining about and leverage that to come up with a solution. This is one of them. Usually if you're in this field, related to it, you might want to start reading research papers on a weekly basis, or at least follow people who do so. For example, I'm necessarily a huge fan of reading typical research papers. I only love reviews – thorough reviews – but I don't usually read the normal papers. But I do follow a lot of people who read papers. Practically all researchers I'm interested in, I follow them. There are enthusiasts – people who are interested in researching specific topics and they share about it. So the only thing I have to do is scroll through my feed and here I am. I know practically everything that there is to know about the latest stuff happening. [chuckles] How do you find them? On Twitter? Oh, simple! It’s just following one person, and then there is a suggestion to follow a couple of others. It’s all on Twitter, right? On Twitter. Because there's a question from Omar, “What's the best way to foster your Twitter?” Oh, cool. Here's the greatest, easiest way. Let's say take you, for example, what is your favorite subject in machine learning or deep learning in general? Okay. Let's say NLP. Alright, cool, NLP. What do you like about NLP? There is so much stuff about it. [chuckles] You're putting me on the spot. [chuckles]\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"Does that mean that if I'm a beginner, I cannot take part in Omdena challenges? You can! That's the thing, you can. They won't block you. [chuckles] It’s just that it’s going to be very overwhelming. But people usually are very nice. If you're not shy, and if you ask for help, everyone will most surely help. People are really nice – everyone is willing to help and ready to help. Okay. Let's say I want to join a challenge – a similar challenge from Omdena, from Fruit Punch AI, from something else, from some other company. Join us! [chuckles] “You” who? AI Wonder Girls! Okay, tell us more about that. We're a group of ladies interested in AI, from different walks of life. There are people who are tech and people who are business-related. We get together and we find a challenge that's interesting for us –a hackathon, competition, you name it. We get together and then work on it. That's it! No, that's not… [cross-talk] Nothing fancy. What are you working on right now? Yeah. Well, right now, I'm not sure if any of us… Because we have a bunch… The name is the same but we have different teams. Any team can – you get at least five ladies together, or three, and then we should do something interesting. There are people who are interested in health care, like me. [chuckles] Most of them, there's something related to health care. I share the link in our WhatsApp group and I'm like, “Ladies are you in? Who's in?” And then we get together, we pump up our first meeting, figure out what they want from us – from a challenge or the hackathon. Obviously, one of the things we really care about is judging criteria. We figure that out first. Then we figure out what they are interested in us helping them solve. Then we brainstorm together, we come up with a couple ideas to explore, we gather data around it. Is it feasible? If it's feasible, we move on and then we start coding. If it's not, then, obviously, we move on to the next idea until we find what we're looking for. We have won a couple of challenges. Actually, from the day we started, we kept winning until now – sometimes we don't win. [chuckles] I have so many questions about winning and challenges. But I want to take a step back. Go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah. So the way it works, as I understood it – there is already a community, this WhatsApp group of ladies, who are interested in AI and doing something with this. There is already a community and there is not necessarily a problem that you want to solve yet. Right? Then somebody (it could be you or could be somebody else) says, “Let's work on this problem.” And then they reply, “Yeah, let's work!” And then you start analyzing this problem, start checking if it's even possible (if it's feasible to solve it). Is there data? Then you go through this process and you understand, “Okay, this is feasible. This is possible. The data is there. Let's work on that.” And then you spend a bit of time (a few weeks, let’s say) working on that. There’s also an objective, I guess. Once you understand, “Okay, we reached the objective,” or maybe, “We did not reach the objective because of (reasons).” Then you finish the project and then the process restarts. You submit. And then it goes up once again. Submit where? For example, if it's a hackathon, usually you'll be submitting your solution to the hackathon. If you check out the post, they have a couple of hackathons. We choose one. One of the things that we're very specific about is that the challenge has to at least touch one SDG goal. It has to have an impact. That's why we are all there. We're interested in impact – in using our AI skills for impact. [cross-talk] So the way I understood it (and it's probably what you’re saying) is that you always come up with problems yourself. But you also mentioned hackathons. I guess the same communities, the same WhatsApp group, where somebody could say, “Okay, I came across this hackathon. Let's take part.” Right? Yeah. Yes. “This hackathon has a good cause. It's for social good. So let's take part.” Yeah, that's it. Can you tell us about one of the hackathons? Yeah. For example, our first hackathon was around medical imaging. It was from Microsoft and Stratica. Actually, that was the first one that started everything. Previously, I really wanted to be part of hackathons. I was amazed by people who got together and came up with a solution and then won something by the end of it [chuckles]. I really wanted to do it. I tried it before – it didn't work. But this time, I was like, “This is really a cool hackathon. We have a bunch of ladies gathered together interested in AI.” So I said, “Let's try my luck.” I copy/pasted the link into the WhatsApp group, and I was like, “Ladies, there's a really super cool hackathon. Would you be interested, by the way, in taking part in it?” That's how 8 ladies got interested. They reached out and said, “Let's do this.” We created our own Discord, created our own channel, and started exchanging ideas around how we could participate and what we could offer. We based it, obviously, on the description and the judging criteria. Usually, in these hackathons, especially if it's from a reputable source, they have mentors. They always provide you with mentors. Because this was around medical communication, they did provide doctors. So we had a meeting with a doctor and we understood their needs. He told us, “We already have AI tools, but we would like it if the AI notified when it was finished its task.” For example, if it was going over a chest X ray, going over a radio and a modality and then notified them about it. Obviously, it should help them actually write the report. One of the issues that usually… It’s not an issue, but one of the things that makes it so difficult to do their job is that – if you remember, in the time of COVID, they had a lot of people coming in. Because almost everyone was touched by it, right? So they were overwhelmed in the radiology section. A radiologist normally has only eight minutes to read the scan and then do the report. So what they wanted us to do was to expedite this part – to actually have the AI come up with the report, and then the radiologist can actually go over the report and fix it, if possible. So that was kind of the final solution that it was about. That’s it – we figure out what the mentors want from us, we review our idea with them, and then keep refining it. Obviously, when you have a couple of engineers put together, most of the time, the solution only comes near the end of the hackathon. [chuckles] You know how we love to work at the last minute. So that's kind of how we usually do it. The whole month where there are sometimes meetings and sometimes talking about the solution, and then in the last week, we’re all rushing and putting it in front of us to be able to deliver the solution we agreed on. Most of the time, we kind of tried to deliver as much as we could. That means, for example, for the medical imaging, we did not only take the red radiology detected (it was about hand fracture) – does the patient have a hand fracture or not? Delivered the report, we also provided a dashboard so they could see all the cases that were coming in and all the details that you can find in a DICOM file. That would be things like gender, demographics – anything you can think of. And then we provided what we call “future work”. That is things like improving the platform, the UI of the platform, the visuals and the delivery, and then sending the message over to their phones, tablets, whatever they have their hands on. In almost all of our hackathons or the challenges we work on, we never provide just one solution. That's actually the power of numbers, because most of the time, we're 5-8 people. We have the luxury of having everyone focus on an aspect that could be added. So we don't work on one solution – we work on several solutions in one package. That's the reason why we win. [chuckles] Obviously, we respect the judging criteria and a lot of other stuff.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"Then in the same way, when you meet people (other freelancers) they might contact you. They kind of act like an agency in this case, because they will take a small part of your fee. But still, it's worth it. Right? In a way. First of all, this doesn't need to always happen. Second of all, the relationship between freelancers and clients is usually a little different. When you bring another freelancer onto a project, you are kind of responsible in the face of the client for the outcomes. Therefore, it's okay that you do charge a buffer, and you might actually need to use that up if the person you hired is not performing. I think it's also beneficial because a lot of new freelancers are actually smart, experienced people that are too afraid to ask for what they're worth. Say they got offers for 60 per hour from some British agency, when you could be putting them on a project where they will be making 100 per hour or something. What do you think about platforms like Upwork? I think they're a waste of time, but other people have had their own experiences. It looks to me like the biggest pro problem, really, when you're hiring a freelancer is that you usually don't know what a good professional looks like. If you have a good relationship with a person, you will try them out and see if they're helping you, and if not – then not. But when you're doing this online, there is no way you will know. Frankly, we'll have a lot of people that are writing bullshit and bidding\\xa0really extremely long projects and stuff for like $5 per hour for development. Let's get real, it's not gonna work out – but the client doesn't know that. Because of that, you're wasting a lot of time. So I think you should always consider what your time is worth. Let's say you set yourself a goal for the month and say, “Okay, I have 170 hours. I want 100 per hour on average, so I need to make 17k.” Give it a shot. If you think this platform is making you that money, then you know that you can keep using it. When you work with your clients, do you normally choose if you want to work remotely or on-site, or is it up to the client? There are many projects where the client has an expectation. It's up to you whether you take the project or not. In my experience, if you have developed a network enough that you can refuse projects, you will find a remote project. All you need to do is say ‘no’ to the ones that want otherwise. Yeah, thanks. You said you're working on something right now – on a prototype. Can you tell us more about this, or it's a bit too early? I can tell you a little bit. But if you stay tuned, I think within a week, I will have this first version. The problem that I'm trying to solve is that data loading is hard. Why is it hard? Because it takes some engineering knowledge, understanding how to design good pipelines, but then you also have the problems that are unrelated to engineering such as data typing, unpacking data, schema migrations. None of the frameworks that we currently have out there have actually solved this problem gracefully. What's worse, the loading frameworks that exist out there have a very tight coupling between the source concept and the target concept. This means that you need to learn the entire framework, you need to understand it in depth, you need to learn object-oriented programming – you need to be a really good software developer to be able to do a simple source and use one of these frameworks. So what I've been working on is a framework that makes this very easy. You give it a JSON list or a JSON generator and it automatically unpacks it. Optionally, it types it – it generates a YAML schema that you can then manually edit and reuse. It uses a loading manifest, so like the merge columns, if you want to load incrementally. Basically, it decouples the source from the loading. If you are able to produce a JSON object or a Pandas data frame – it doesn't matter – if it's nested or whatever, this unpacker is gonna manage it, type it, rename the columns to something that works in the database, and then you can access it with SQL. Looks pretty useful. Is it something that you saw that many clients have problems with? And that’s why you ended up implementing this? It's something that we ended up creating because of this Rasa data pipeline project that we did. What happened there is – essentially the data is available for consumption as a conversation object. And this conversation object can be extremely complex because it has the entire conversation and all the technical actions that happen – like all the guesses the bot might make and stuff like that. Rasa is a chatbot company, right? Yeah, open source chatbot company. Essentially, you don't know what you will find in the subject because it depends on implementation. Even the schema is not really fixed. So we needed a way to manage a very volatile schema, but also be able to freeze it if we wanted to. I heard that many people want to go to consulting, to freelancing, but they don't want to do it forever. Because here, you exchange time for money, but at some point, maybe you just want to get money without spending time. [chuckles] Is this usually what freelancers do at the end? They see a problem that is repeated many times, so they end up packaging it as a product and then sell it as a product? Some people, yes – because they get bored. But each person has their own ambitions and approaches. Some people simply go three days a week and enjoy a richer life. Other people start companies, other people don't care, and just work like that. Other people put all their money in Bitcoin and cash out enough to retire. No joke. One of my mentees in freelancing did that. Yeah, every person has their own dreams and ambitions. When did he invest in Bitcoin? Like in 2012? I don't really want to talk about his finances, but he took it when he was a freelancer and I think he invested in January before last year. [cross-talk] It was already expensive then, right? Yeah, so I think he went like 3 or 5X or something and he cashed it out in Portugal, where he didn't have to pay tax. So he moved smart. As a freelancer you can do that. [chuckles] Okay, thanks. We have a bunch of other questions. Would you recommend building a portfolio to showcase your skill and for reaching out to new customers? I recommend building a portfolio of products you can reuse, and basically do it again for other customers. That's going to be efficient. Because in my experience, if customers like you and you tell them that you can do it, then they will give you a shot. [cross-talk] This tool that you're developing is one of such things, right? If somebody has a problem, then you can say, “Hey, you know what? I actually have a solution for you. Let's give it a try. This is the solution. I can implement it for you, if you want.” And typically, they will agree. Right? Exactly. For example, this tool that I'm talking about for data loading – I'm personally using it to create really good pipelines. But it's also usable by someone that doesn't want to create really good pipelines, but just wants to throw some stuff in a database. If a client wants it done commercial-grade, and with a nice DBT package on top of that, it has iterative [cross-talk]. It’s cross-database compatible and all the nice stuff with rebuilding states, having a nice schema. For example, for us, we even inject templates into my database through the API. So yeah, if you want something like that, of course, it's not open source anymore. [chuckles] [cross-talk] But still, you want to show them that you can solve their problems as quickly as possible, right? Yeah. Okay. But I guess a portfolio is a good start anyways, right? If you don't have a portfolio of reusable things, a portfolio with projects you solved is already good enough.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"Yeah. So the way it works, as I understood it – there is already a community, this WhatsApp group of ladies, who are interested in AI and doing something with this. There is already a community and there is not necessarily a problem that you want to solve yet. Right? Then somebody (it could be you or could be somebody else) says, “Let's work on this problem.” And then they reply, “Yeah, let's work!” And then you start analyzing this problem, start checking if it's even possible (if it's feasible to solve it). Is there data? Then you go through this process and you understand, “Okay, this is feasible. This is possible. The data is there. Let's work on that.” And then you spend a bit of time (a few weeks, let’s say) working on that. There’s also an objective, I guess. Once you understand, “Okay, we reached the objective,” or maybe, “We did not reach the objective because of (reasons).” Then you finish the project and then the process restarts. You submit. And then it goes up once again. Submit where? For example, if it's a hackathon, usually you'll be submitting your solution to the hackathon. If you check out the post, they have a couple of hackathons. We choose one. One of the things that we're very specific about is that the challenge has to at least touch one SDG goal. It has to have an impact. That's why we are all there. We're interested in impact – in using our AI skills for impact. [cross-talk] So the way I understood it (and it's probably what you’re saying) is that you always come up with problems yourself. But you also mentioned hackathons. I guess the same communities, the same WhatsApp group, where somebody could say, “Okay, I came across this hackathon. Let's take part.” Right? Yeah. Yes. “This hackathon has a good cause. It's for social good. So let's take part.” Yeah, that's it. Can you tell us about one of the hackathons? Yeah. For example, our first hackathon was around medical imaging. It was from Microsoft and Stratica. Actually, that was the first one that started everything. Previously, I really wanted to be part of hackathons. I was amazed by people who got together and came up with a solution and then won something by the end of it [chuckles]. I really wanted to do it. I tried it before – it didn't work. But this time, I was like, “This is really a cool hackathon. We have a bunch of ladies gathered together interested in AI.” So I said, “Let's try my luck.” I copy/pasted the link into the WhatsApp group, and I was like, “Ladies, there's a really super cool hackathon. Would you be interested, by the way, in taking part in it?” That's how 8 ladies got interested. They reached out and said, “Let's do this.” We created our own Discord, created our own channel, and started exchanging ideas around how we could participate and what we could offer. We based it, obviously, on the description and the judging criteria. Usually, in these hackathons, especially if it's from a reputable source, they have mentors. They always provide you with mentors. Because this was around medical communication, they did provide doctors. So we had a meeting with a doctor and we understood their needs. He told us, “We already have AI tools, but we would like it if the AI notified when it was finished its task.” For example, if it was going over a chest X ray, going over a radio and a modality and then notified them about it. Obviously, it should help them actually write the report. One of the issues that usually… It’s not an issue, but one of the things that makes it so difficult to do their job is that – if you remember, in the time of COVID, they had a lot of people coming in. Because almost everyone was touched by it, right? So they were overwhelmed in the radiology section. A radiologist normally has only eight minutes to read the scan and then do the report. So what they wanted us to do was to expedite this part – to actually have the AI come up with the report, and then the radiologist can actually go over the report and fix it, if possible. So that was kind of the final solution that it was about. That’s it – we figure out what the mentors want from us, we review our idea with them, and then keep refining it. Obviously, when you have a couple of engineers put together, most of the time, the solution only comes near the end of the hackathon. [chuckles] You know how we love to work at the last minute. So that's kind of how we usually do it. The whole month where there are sometimes meetings and sometimes talking about the solution, and then in the last week, we’re all rushing and putting it in front of us to be able to deliver the solution we agreed on. Most of the time, we kind of tried to deliver as much as we could. That means, for example, for the medical imaging, we did not only take the red radiology detected (it was about hand fracture) – does the patient have a hand fracture or not? Delivered the report, we also provided a dashboard so they could see all the cases that were coming in and all the details that you can find in a DICOM file. That would be things like gender, demographics – anything you can think of. And then we provided what we call “future work”. That is things like improving the platform, the UI of the platform, the visuals and the delivery, and then sending the message over to their phones, tablets, whatever they have their hands on. In almost all of our hackathons or the challenges we work on, we never provide just one solution. That's actually the power of numbers, because most of the time, we're 5-8 people. We have the luxury of having everyone focus on an aspect that could be added. So we don't work on one solution – we work on several solutions in one package. That's the reason why we win. [chuckles] Obviously, we respect the judging criteria and a lot of other stuff. Do I understand correctly…? There's actually a question that reads, “What's the key to winning a hackathon?” So let me try to summarize what you said and then maybe we will add more. First of all, you have a mentor, and you need to get the most from this mentor to really understand what they want from you. These people will tell you what kind of things you need to do. Right? [Sara agrees] So they will help you understand the criteria. They will help you to understand what exactly you need to give at the end. Wait. By the way, they won't tell you. You need to get it out of them. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. Of course. So it's not like they just tell you “Oh, here. By the way, this is how you do this.” So you ask. You will tell us how to do this, but let me finish the summary. Then the second thing is, you don't focus on one single thing. Once you figure out, “Okay, this is the problem. This is the solution,” you then explore other solutions and you think, “Okay, there are two-three potential things we can do. How can we put them in one package – to form one solution from them?” And then you split into subgroups and work on these sub-solutions and then present it as a whole thing. So that's the key to winning – understanding requirements, talking to your mentors, and presenting multiple solutions. Is there anything else? What else would you add? Yeah. You can think of it like a business. In business, you obviously have clients, and you have an offer. Right? So one of the key criteria in business is to understand your client – to be able to provide them with the offer that is going to suit them, right? This is very similar in hackathons or challenges or anything you're doing. So you need to understand the judges. So what do the judges care about? You first need to know who they are, if it's possible. Otherwise, you need to read through the lines. What matters to these people? What is it that they are stressed about that you really want to get up? So this is the most crucial part. And you need to be very careful of the judging criteria. So what do they want? What are they going to be giving notes on? For example, if they care about inclusion – nice! In your presentation, make sure you leverage the fact that you're an amazing eight ladies from all over the world [chuckles] and working on AI. This is a winning point in one of the judging criteria, for example. So if they care about something specific – let's say they care about the environment – figure out a way to add environments to your solution. So figure out how to leverage what they're looking for, what they care about, as judges – as people – and then, as organizers of the hackathon. If you try to figure out what they want out of the hackathon, that's the best way to win – to understand what they want and deliver on it, as best you can. That's the winning criteria. That's smart. Is there something that most people miss? I guess if there is a list of criteria, then most people try to… “Okay, they care about the environment. Let's set something…” Is there something that most people miss? Yes. You don't? No, there is. There's one thing actually that we all miss. It's the fact that we say, “I can't do this.” So what I invite you to do is not to think about the fact that you can't do this, but think about what you can do with what you have. For example, let's say I want to build a model that detects if someone has hair loss or not through, for example, some kind of data from bio (not from images). It's difficult if you don't have the data. But what if you got creative around it? You really have to have that data? Isn't there some kind of other place where you can find similar data? Or you can… With LLMs right now, you can create your own data. Because what they're looking for is for you to show them that it's possible to be done. In a hackathon, they're not looking for the final solution. That's not possible. When you have one to two months, you can only come up with an MVP. Right? That's what you want to do. Focus on how you can build the MVP and don't think about, “I don't have the means.” For example, if you lack computational power, there is Goggle, there is Colab. Leverage the resources you have. Get creative around which you can build. This is one of the reasons why we usually fail in hackathons – people give up too early, because when they get into the solution, they're like, “Oh, my God! What did I get into? This is not possible to be done.” But that's not how you should approach it. So the state… The mindset. Right. The mindset should be not, “It's not possible,” but “How can I do something that brings me closer?” Right? And then it could be just maybe taking a step back and then exploring other ways to do this. Instead of getting data, you generate the data, or as you said… Or get it from social media, research papers…\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"The more GPUs you have, the higher the chances something will go wrong, right? Yes, and you need to manage that at scale. There are many other issues to address, but handling this one is a major challenge. Do you know what this actually looks like? There’s probably a computer with 4 or 8 GPUs, another one with 4 or 8 GPUs, and all these computers are part of a network. You need to distribute the training process across all these machines, where each computer has several GPUs, and each GPU needs to compute something and then send the weights or gradients back to a central location. Is this roughly how it works? Yes, but like any complex problem, it can be split into smaller tasks and solved at different levels of abstraction. Generally speaking, there’s PyTorch, a framework mostly developed by Meta, designed for training. Distributed training is one of its main use cases. So, this is what is used for models like LLaMA, right? It’s based on PyTorch? Yes, but I’m basing my response on the latest LLaMA training report. Even though earlier versions were trained with something else, I don’t think PyTorch was used. When we download models from Hugging Face Hub, we use the Transformers package, right? That’s based on PyTorch? Yes, but the important point here isn’t that it’s PyTorch. It’s just that many people, including Meta, are using it. Google, on the other hand, isn’t using PyTorch, though I’m not sure about all the specifics of their model training process. But PyTorch is just a tool in the framework—beneath it, there’s a backend responsible for communication between the GPUs. One popular backend is called NCCL, which handles communication for distributed training. For example, when training frontier models, this backend can be a major source of frustration, leading teams to sometimes reimplement it from scratch to optimize the process. To summarize, there’s a trend in training large language models: earlier, it was mostly about using raw computing power, like Meta with its massive number of GPUs. They would throw a problem at a fraction of these GPUs, and they’d process it. But not every company has the resources that Meta or Google do. Smaller companies like DeepMind are now focusing on being smarter with their resources, rather than relying on brute force. We see the trend shifting toward optimization—how can companies train models without access to massive GPU clusters? And then there’s the case where many companies aren’t training models but just need to use them. If I need a model and don’t have a specific use case, I could take an existing model and fine-tune it—or maybe I don’t need to fine-tune it at all. For many companies, especially those not AI-first, the challenges are different. They’re more focused on fine-tuning and serving the model. What do you think the challenges are for these companies that are just using models rather than training them? Correct, although I’d be cautious about labeling companies as small or medium. I think it’s more about whether a company is AI-first or not. Once you figure that out, everything becomes much clearer. If a company is AI-first, they’re likely to customize models to optimize performance, and the choice between pre-training or fine-tuning depends on their resources. If a company isn’t AI-first, like a large bank focused on privacy, they might not need to dive deeply into AI but still want to use it in their services. Some banks may even decide to become AI-first, just like how many banks once went software-first or mobile-first. Becoming AI-first requires a complete shift. To do that, you’d need to rethink the entire structure of the company. Yes, some companies, like certain banks, may decide to become AI-first. They’d need to define what that means for them. For example, you might have banks that are not AI-first, but then new AI-focused banks emerge. But to get back to your main point, the challenge for most companies is that they don’t need to train models from scratch. Instead, they focus on customization and fine-tuning, especially in industries like finance. They might not have the resources for extensive training, but they’ll want to leverage AI in their operations, and fine-tuning helps with that. Open-source solutions are making this process easier, enabling companies to use existing models and tools rather than building everything from the ground up. Even AI-first companies will use these open-source tools to optimize development and efficiency. So, for these companies, the majority are non-AI-first companies, looking for existing solutions rather than building everything themselves? Interestingly, those companies that initially built their own models have started switching to existing solutions. They realized that maintaining their custom-built solutions wasn’t sustainable, and the open-source alternatives are more efficient. Exactly, they try to implement something themselves, but then find that other solutions can solve the problem more effectively. Once they realize that, they prefer to adopt a pre-built solution instead of maintaining their own. Yes, absolutely. Everyone is looking for ways to improve what they already do, but with less effort. But when it comes to AI tools, it's not just about being AI-first or not. For example, take Kubernetes. We see it as a foundational platform, not just for AI-first or cloud-first companies, but for everyone. It’s universal and adaptable to various use cases, whether expert-level or beginner-level. It’s about reducing the cost of ownership by investing in one universal tool. This approach is challenging to implement, but it's what we strive for—making it flexible and accessible for all types of use cases. Okay, but if we already have Kubernetes, why do we need another universal tool? I remember back when Kubernetes was mentioned, I was intimidated. I didn’t want to go near it, but once I understood how it worked, it turned out to be much easier. The main challenge is that not every company has the team to manage Kubernetes. Yes, exactly. This is one of the topics that requires more discussion. But at a high level, we’re focused on teams that are constrained by Kubernetes or other orchestration tools. Many teams experience specific pain points when working with Kubernetes, especially for AI use cases. Kubernetes wasn’t designed with AI in mind—it’s optimized for containers, but AI workflows often involve more complex processes like training. For instance, AI engineers don’t typically think in terms of containers; they think in terms of nodes and GPUs. This is why specialized tools like SLURM exist. It simplifies the process, and engineers prefer it because it’s tailored for AI workflows. This is one of the challenges we’re trying to solve: rethinking container orchestration for AI. So, the problem with Kubernetes is that it’s not optimized for AI use cases? Exactly. Kubernetes is great for general container orchestration, but it doesn’t handle the specific needs of AI workflows. That's why we believe it’s time to rethink how container orchestration works for AI. We’re trying to create a tool that addresses these specific needs while remaining flexible and universal. As a software engineer, should I stay away from Kubernetes, or is it still a good tool to have in my toolkit? It's the only tool when it comes to deployment. It is the only one. Regardless of whether you use AWS, Azure, or even Alibaba Cloud, you end up using Kubernetes. I personally don't use it, but the projects I work on are smaller. I don't want to pay for a large Kubernetes cluster, but for companies with more than one person, it probably makes sense. Yes, there are edge cases, but I’m speaking in more general terms. Here's a question: Do you think the future will be a hybrid of bare metal and cloud, or will it be cloud-only? Predicting the future is not easy, and some people enjoy making these predictions. If we extrapolate current trends, though... Cloud is the trend, and it’s the only trend.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"So what if I'm the least creative person on Earth? How do I go about being creative when it comes to getting data? That's a cool question. Well, thanks to generative AI, you have ChatGPT, you have Gemini, you have all kinds of AIs to help you get creative. You can just go around and say, “I want to build this solution.” Just tell it everything you have as a problem. “There is no data. I have never worked on this before. I only have experience with basic machine learning models. How can I win this hackathon with the following judgment criteria?” Give it all the descriptions and let it run wild. The only thing you have to do is pick the solution that you feel most comfortable with. Yeah. So, basically just tell the Chatbot all you know about the problem. Yes, sure. What do you want from it? This is just one way. If we didn't have AI, how can you do that? One of the best ways is… One of the things I forgot to talk about is your team. You need to pick the right people in your team. In your team, there is a need for someone to be creative. There is a need for someone to love doing things – someone who is going to build the actual solution. There is a need for someone who is a little bit technical – they don't have to 1000 percent know how to do it, but they at least have to know how to do something. So your team is one of your assets. If you can't, or if you're not creative, but you want to get ideas – simple. There are a couple of ways you can do it. First things first. You can go to Reddit, figure out what people mainly complain about in that subject area. Here you go. Here's your idea. There's a lot of complaints. Just pick the one that you find the most relatable to the hackathon or challenge or research. If you're doing research, by the way, this is the same thing. Whatever project you want to start, even a startup, go do some market research. Try to understand what people are complaining about and leverage that to come up with a solution. This is one of them. Usually if you're in this field, related to it, you might want to start reading research papers on a weekly basis, or at least follow people who do so. For example, I'm necessarily a huge fan of reading typical research papers. I only love reviews – thorough reviews – but I don't usually read the normal papers. But I do follow a lot of people who read papers. Practically all researchers I'm interested in, I follow them. There are enthusiasts – people who are interested in researching specific topics and they share about it. So the only thing I have to do is scroll through my feed and here I am. I know practically everything that there is to know about the latest stuff happening. [chuckles] How do you find them? On Twitter? Oh, simple! It’s just following one person, and then there is a suggestion to follow a couple of others. It’s all on Twitter, right? On Twitter. Because there's a question from Omar, “What's the best way to foster your Twitter?” Oh, cool. Here's the greatest, easiest way. Let's say take you, for example, what is your favorite subject in machine learning or deep learning in general? Okay. Let's say NLP. Alright, cool, NLP. What do you like about NLP? There is so much stuff about it. [chuckles] You're putting me on the spot. [chuckles] A quick one. Let's say transformers. Transformers. I was going to say “fake news”. But let's say “transformers”. That's good. Let’s take fake news. The only thing I'm gonna do is go to Google Scholar and type “NLP, fake news”. Then I will get a couple of papers, suggestions, and based on your preferences, you can rank by date. Then you can check out their papers. Someone you like – their papers you like – try to figure out if they are on Twitter. If they're not on Twitter, try to figure out if they're on LinkedIn. So try to figure out the people that you’d like to subscribe to and just follow them. Or you can just use hashtags. Use #NLP, #fakenews in the search bar of Twitter, and you have a couple of people that you can check out. Obviously, before you click on “follow,” please make sure that you check out all of their feeds to be sure that it aligns with your values. Otherwise, you might get some very bad, expected stuff. Even though they are researchers, they're also people, and they might share their travel plans. Yeah, just make sure that it aligns with your values. Okay. So, find things on Google Scholar, and then find the people on Twitter. Or attend conferences if you're not a research person. Attend an event and get to know people. See if they have Twitter. If you like someone, ask for their Twitter or their social media. Okay and then… [cross-talk] If you don't have the budget, for example, to attend a conference (because sometimes it's expensive) what you can do is go to the conference you like, and then see the speakers list. Usually they provide the program for free – you can just check it out and see the talk that you like. By the way, try your chance, copy/paste the title and their name and see if the talk has been recorded – if it's on YouTube, or if it's even shared on social media. Or just Google it and see if it's shared. Obviously, watch it, see if you like it. If you like it, then follow that person. Otherwise, move on. I mean, just research. Use your creativity. And then, as you said, once you follow one person then Twitter suggests others. Then you can follow the others. Yes. “Like” that person. Okay. That's smart. Thank you. So, another question. “Can you share tips on how to apply for these volunteering projects?”\"}]"
